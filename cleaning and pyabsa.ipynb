       "37518  The company is compiled of 90% student employees, however, team leaders at Hastings, do not remember this, and it is an ordeal for students to get time off for exams If a student needs time off for exams and they have the holiday time available management should not require them to make up the time, they should have the option to use a holiday. The company should not be allowed to deny any student time off for exams. I have been there for three years and I notice the changes; now it is a pressure cooker. The original TL I had recently quit because the direction the company is going in is not about treating employees fairly. The TL's have their favourites and if you are not one of them you will be subjected to bullying. Upper management does nothing to intervene and you are treated like just a number, and your only purpose here is to make as much money for the company as possible and spend less time on the phone trying to help customers. Different information told from coaches so customers are angry. Some TL's have inappropriate relationships with team members. No chance for advancement in the company unless you are friends with TL's\\r\\n\\r\\nShow Less\\r\\nAdvice to Management   \n",

       "37518  The company is compiled of 90% student employees, however, team leaders at Hastings, do not remember this, and it is an ordeal for students to get time off for exams If a student needs time off for exams and they have the holiday time available management should not require them to make up the time, they should have the option to use a holiday. The company should not be allowed to deny any student time off for exams. I have been there for three years and I notice the changes; now it is a pressure cooker. The original TL I had recently quit because the direction the company is going in is not about treating employees fairly. The TL's have their favourites and if you are not one of them you will be subjected to bullying. Upper management does nothing to intervene and you are treated like just a number, and your only purpose here is to make as much money for the company as possible and spend less time on the phone trying to help customers. Different information told from coaches so customers are angry. Some TL's have inappropriate relationships with team members.

There are some opportunities to work from home.\\r\\nPromotion prospects are good, generally speaking.   \n",

       "37518  The company is compiled of 90% student employees, however, team leaders at Hastings, do not remember this, and it is an ordeal for students to get time off for exams If a student needs time off for exams and they have the holiday time available management should not require them to make up the time, they should have the option to use a holiday. The company should not be allowed to deny any student time off for exams. I have been there for three years and I notice the changes; now it is a pressure cooker. The original TL I had recently quit because the direction the company is going in is not about treating employees fairly. The TL's have their favourites and if you are not one of them you will be subjected to bullying. Upper management does nothing to intervene and you are treated like just a number, and your only purpose here is to make as much money for the company as possible and spend less time on the phone trying to help customers. Different information told from coaches so customers are angry. Some TL's have inappropriate relationships with team members.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
