    "# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA): Cleaning, Detection & Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract structured signals from unstructured Glassdoor reviews, this notebook applies **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** on the `pros` and `cons` sections of each review. The final goal is to build company-level summaries of how employees feel about different aspects like “pay”, “management”, or “culture”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed in several key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Sampling & Cleaning**  \n",
    "   We preprocess a small sample of reviews using four distinct cleaning strategies to test which one yields the most accurate aspect detection and sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modeling Approaches for ABSA**  \n",
    "   We implement two models:\n",
    "   - **PyABSA** for automatic aspect term extraction\n",
    "   - **BERT-based classifier** for assigning sentiment scores to each known aspect\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual Aspect Dictionary Construction**  \n",
    "   Using PyABSA output and domain knowledge, we build an enhanced dictionary of aspects and their keywords (e.g., “pay” includes \"salary\", \"bonus\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pipeline Evaluation**  \n",
    "   We test four cleaning variants using a manually annotated evaluation set and compare performance across accuracy metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Full Dataset Inference**  \n",
    "   Once the best approach is identified, we apply it to the full dataset to generate aspect-based star ratings, which feed into downstream company analysis, recommendation, and summarization.\n"

       "37518  The company is compiled of 90% student employees, however, team leaders at Hastings, do not remember this, and it is an ordeal for students to get time off for exams If a student needs time off for exams and they have the holiday time available management should not require them to make up the time, they should have the option to use a holiday. The company should not be allowed to deny any student time off for exams. I have been there for three years and I notice the changes; now it is a pressure cooker. The original TL I had recently quit because the direction the company is going in is not about treating employees fairly. The TL's have their favourites and if you are not one of them you will be subjected to bullying. Upper management does nothing to intervene and you are treated like just a number, and your only purpose here is to make as much money for the company as possible and spend less time on the phone trying to help customers. Different information told from coaches so customers are angry. Some TL's have inappropriate relationships with team members.

       "37518  The company is compiled of 90% student employees, however, team leaders at Hastings, do not remember this, and it is an ordeal for students to get time off for exams If a student needs time off for exams and they have the holiday time available management should not require them to make up the time, they should have the option to use a holiday. The company should not be allowed to deny any student time off for exams. I have been there for three years and I notice the changes; now it is a pressure cooker. The original TL I had recently quit because the direction the company is going in is not about treating employees fairly. The TL's have their favourites and if you are not one of them you will be subjected to bullying. Upper management does nothing to intervene and you are treated like just a number, and your only purpose here is to make as much money for the company as possible and spend less time on the phone trying to help customers. Different information told from coaches so customers are angry. Some TL's have inappropriate relationships with team members. No chance for advancement in the company unless you are friends with TL's  Show Less Advice to Management   \n",

Micromanagement from 'team leaders' who think they are something special when really the power of managing someone else gets to their head. You cannot take sick leave/ trips to the doctor or you are given a warning The hours are nearly 12 hour days, starting with pointless morning and afternoon meetings The uniform policy is very strict and they treat you like children. You have no work-life balance, say goodbye to your 'outside work friend' and say hello to your new foxtons family, you eat, sleep and play with them. - I say sleep literally as there are a lot of relationships that go on with people in the same offices, (lots of bias and nepotism)   \n",

       "37518  The company is compiled of 90% student employees, however, team leaders at Hastings, do not remember this, and it is an ordeal for students to get time off for exams If a student needs time off for exams and they have the holiday time available management should not require them to make up the time, they should have the option to use a holiday. The company should not be allowed to deny any student time off for exams. I have been there for three years and I notice the changes; now it is a pressure cooker. The original TL I had recently quit because the direction the company is going in is not about treating employees fairly. The TL's have their favourites and if you are not one of them you will be subjected to bullying. Upper management does nothing to intervene and you are treated like just a number, and your only purpose here is to make as much money for the company as possible and spend less time on the phone trying to help customers. Different information told from coaches so customers are angry. Some TL's have inappropriate relationships with team members.
