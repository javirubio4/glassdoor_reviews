If you are a junior life can be hard at KPMG. Management does not encourage mobility as it makes their life difficult by losing a team member. Company wide bonus is depleted when firm targets are not met to ensure the discretionary bonus for managers and above are paid in full. 

It differs from team to team, maybe I have been especially unlucky, but in my role I am expected to put in 10-12 hour days everyday during busy season, even if managers have left before me. The turnover within my team is ridiculous (most people haven't even been here a year) and nobody has ever been promoted within team from assistant manager to manager. In three years i have never been to a client meeting. Loss making clients are kept for no other reason than it's better to have them. Juniors are then criticised for not being able to make the account profitable.",2017,reputation always look good to have big 4 experience on your cv exposure there be a lot of different client that you could in theory be involve in high management the exco team have great idea for the firm and culture if be unfortunately the middle management that fail to implement and support these initiative,salary bonus culture benefit if you be a junior life can be hard at kpmg management do not encourage mobility as it make their life difficult by lose a team member company wide bonus be deplete when firm target be not meet to ensure the discretionary bonus for manager and above be pay in full it differ from team to team maybe I have be especially unlucky but in my role I be expect to put in 10 12 hour day everyday during busy season even if manager have leave before I the turnover within my team be ridiculous most people have not even be here a year and nobody have ever be promote within team from assistant manager to manager in three year I have never be to a client meeting loss make client be keep for no other reason than it be well to have they junior be then criticise for not be able to make the account profitable,not good for anyone below manager level,False,False,"{'management': {1: 0.059178956, 2: 0.12898275, 3: 0.32709438, 4: 0.3599958, 5: 0.1247481, 'label': 4}, 'culture': {1: 0.06563847, 2: 0.14330983, 3: 0.32496285, 4: 0.34557763, 5: 0.12051128, 'label': 4}, 'tools & resources': {1: 0.04288551, 2: 0.102106504, 3: 0.30671632, 4: 0.40514472, 5: 0.14314693, 'label': 4}, 'teamwork & collaboration': {1: 0.03488681, 2: 0.0824736, 3: 0.2890287, 4: 0.43382972, 5: 0.15978108, 'label': 4}}","{'pay': {1: 0.65000576, 2: 0.2659664, 3: 0.067133084, 4: 0.011685712, 5: 0.005209141, 'label': 1}, 'management': {1: 0.6444572, 2: 0.27435613, 3: 0.06618299, 4: 0.01056687, 5: 0.00443673, 'label': 1}, 'culture': {1: 0.6254575, 2: 0.28341696, 3: 0.07215442, 4: 0.013151222, 5: 0.0058198334, 'label': 1}, 'travel': {1: 0.6433723, 2: 0.27052847, 3: 0.06847925, 4: 0.012238403, 5: 0.0053815804, 'label': 1}, 'people': {1: 0.6706054, 2: 0.25786716, 3: 0.05738465, 4: 0.009694226, 5: 0.0044485466, 'label': 1}, 'job role clarity': {1: 0.5678086, 2: 0.3087206, 3: 0.09878092, 4: 0.017796341, 5: 0.0068935505, 'label': 1}, 'teamwork & collaboration': {1: 0.6196598, 2: 0.2853187, 3: 0.074757285, 4: 0.014184452, 5: 0.00607984, 'label': 1}}","{'management': {1: 0.06194634, 2: 0.16787145, 3: 0.38828135, 4: 0.30975524, 5: 0.07214558, 'label': 3}, 'culture': {1: 0.0680564, 2: 0.19101064, 3: 0.3903971, 4: 0.28726408, 5: 0.06327175, 'label': 3}, 'tools & resources': {1: 0.057031825, 2: 0.16452329, 3: 0.38111463, 4: 0.32363316, 5: 0.07369707, 'label': 3}, 'teamwork & collaboration': {1: 0.048859842, 2: 0.14474176, 3: 0.377521, 4: 0.3499272, 5: 0.0789503, 'label': 3}}","{'pay': {1: 0.51955664, 2: 0.39616945, 3: 0.07045031, 4: 0.010323775, 5: 0.0034998206, 'label': 1}, 'management': {1: 0.51091105, 2: 0.40781897, 3: 0.069198236, 4: 0.00919518, 5: 0.0028765535, 'label': 1}, 'culture': {1: 0.48215693, 2: 0.42307472, 3: 0.07952693, 4: 0.011603315, 5: 0.0036380815, 'label': 1}, 'travel': {1: 0.49617627, 2: 0.41117182, 3: 0.077254795, 4: 0.011647368, 5: 0.0037496842, 'label': 1}, 'benefits': {1: 0.470746, 2: 0.4294499, 3: 0.08426659, 4: 0.011976075, 5: 0.0035614683, 'label': 1}, 'people': {1: 0.52327126, 2: 0.39701486, 3: 0.06667089, 4: 0.0097446535, 5: 0.0032983676, 'label': 1}, 'job role clarity': {1: 0.42226264, 2: 0.4554962, 3: 0.105272844, 4: 0.013599803, 5: 0.003368504, 'label': 2}, 'teamwork & collaboration': {1: 0.4686972, 2: 0.43873018, 3: 0.07874929, 4: 0.010727372, 5: 0.0030958892, 'label': 1}}"
