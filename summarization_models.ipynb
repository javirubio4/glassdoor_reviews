Overall there are individual admin staff that are very nice and helpful. Free parking . Meet some nice people in the teams . Flexible hours . Benefits sickness death in service bonus if you employed for over 1 year .. I find AFH to be a caring employer, that is both adaptable to  employees' needs and prepared to listen to opinions.   Since I've worked at AFH there have been many progressive changes for the workforce in the way of employee benefits (for example, these include a savings scheme, discounted gym membership, annual company events and after-hours classes such as French and Pilates).   The office itself is a great working environment, with a friendly and open staff who make newcomers welcome.   There is ample free &amp; secure staff parking available and the train/bus route is convenient. Staff inductions are always carried out and training needs are regularly monitored.   Progression through the company is encouraged and it's possible to change career paths internally if opportunities arise.. AFH is a great company to work for. The training courses available are brilliant, from Excel training to product knowledge, all courses are available to all staff. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming. The CEO always acknowledges you when he sees you, as do all management. We have annual staff events (summer events and christmas parties) which are a great way to mingle with staff from other levels of the office. There are a number of other pros for working for AFH such as: - discount at local gyms - Saving Schemes - family fun day bbqs - great atmosphere working the office - annual bonus - secure parking - payrise based on performance.. ...The list could go on!!  Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company.  We have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.  All in all I really enjoy working for AFH!. Big group of young people. There are opportunities to advance and progress in different directions. A great place to work with a really caring and great employer. Nothing! The whole package was completely  mis-sold. All sounded too good to be true and it was.. hours ok colleagues and line managers are really nice. Friendly people, almost like a family!. I joined AFH in December 2017 and have found them to be a truly great company to work for. On week one meetings were arranged for me with all the Senior Managers from the various departments so I could understand the different parts of the business.  There is a good positive atmosphere at AFH and you are actively encouraged to talk openly about any issues including with the CEO. The benefits package is good but just as important, you are made to feel valued and recognised for a job well done. I work with many teams across AFH and find them to be helpful and generous with their time.  Good work / life balance is also very much in evidence.. I jumped from a bankassurance world into the world of IFA and was very careful about selecting AFH as I interviewed with plenty of companies before choosing this one.  Everything they told me about themselves was true, as I found out later, and they put their money where their mouth is when they say they put clients first, which is incredibly refreshing after working for banks who say one thing and do another.  Everyone is happy to help and support you where they can, and I am left to do my own thing successfully and build my own business without micromanagement, which for me is crucial!   AFH look after their staff well,  and it's a pleasure to work for a company who you feel are working in the right way for their staff, themselves and their clients.. AFH really does pride itself on looking after it's clients and this is evident in the way it supports staff to progress with qualifications. Individuals who work for AFH get the opportunity to develop and progress if they put the work in.  Lovely office and very friendly staff..

Great working atmosphere, lots of chance for progression. Great office and working environment, good on-site facilities, gym, roof terrace and large communal area. Well organised and well attended company events, Financial support for relevant professional qualifications.. I've been working at AJ Bell for over 15 years and during that time have worked in 5 different roles, progressing each time to the role I am in now. The business is at a scale now which means there is genuine opportunity to not only progress but also to diversify in terms of the direction of your career and also your skills.  There is a real family feel here and I feel genuinely valued as an employee. Having a young family myself and a full time job can be tricky to manage, but AJ Bell have been nothing but supportive to incorporate flexibility where possible. The on-site gym, pay day drinks and numerous opportunities to socialise with team mates are a real bonus to an already great business.. Great culture within the business towards staff and customers - really refreshing to work at a place like this.  Supportive - Management within my area have been amazing in support given for training, progression, workload and even personal life. They really care about you and not just hitting targets.  Successful - whilst no job is 100% stable because of how good the company is I feel a greater level of security than I have elsewhere. The company is profitable, expanding and has even got through the COVID 19 pandemic without furloughing staff and impacting customers (in fact they have provided charitable funds and goods to those that need it most)..

A strong sense of togetherness is seen across the business through a blend of social events and also numerous areas for social interaction within the office.. Great office space, friendly staff, great opportunities for progression!!. If you like working for a company that is sexist, where senior management dont care for staff and point the finger and blame others, then this is the company for you. If you want to progress, you either have to sleep with a senior manager, director or be married to them. If you want to complain, this wont be heard as cover ups as are frequent and dont they dont take it seriously. They have a conflict of interest as senior managers are married to directors, so they are all in a click. Nice building and metro link is on the doorstep..

There is opportunity to progress. good company to work for, nice office.. AJ Bell is an excellent company with a good pay scale and plenty of incentives.. If you're happy to accept an average salary and poor benefits to get your foot in the door of the Financial Services industry then AJ Bell is the place for you. The low bar for staff entry means you can get your first experience in Financial Services before moving on to a company that actually protects and values its staff. My advice to anyone looking to work at AJ Bell is to use it as a stepping stone in your career. Get the experience, and the name on your CV, then get out.. Nice offices and some nice people work there. Great people and culture, loads of opportunity for progression and development. Very supportive when serious illness affects you.. Great momentum after the company floated. One of the best employers in UK. Great employee benefits Good working atmosphere Flexible working.

AJ Bell is one of the best organisations I have worked for. Its inclusive, friendly and very secure. Having moved from a more sales based organisation it is a breath of fresh air to not be KPI driven and particularly right now, to know that I am working in an very stable industry. I have been promoted since being here, put through formal qualifications and feel like a valued member of the AJ Bell team. The potential to work from home more in a post covid world is a big benefit for me. I'm excited for the future of my career.. Pay day drinks, Christmas/Summer party, virtual events during lockdown.. Company drinks, good Christmas / Summer do, nice people. Good work / life balance when volumes are lower.. Near to home, great people. Study package, friendly working environment.. Friendly team who are helpful and approachable. Good manager who will spare me time even when theyre really busy.   Good that you can take professional qualifications paid for by the company.  Some of the reviews on Glassdoor about AJ bell just do not reflect my experience of working here - Ive had good support from my manager and the HR team when Ive needed it.  I think AJ Bell has done a good job of looking after its staff during Covid.. Good social events and Christmas parties.. Good social events before Covid. Decent bonuses/ payrises.. Other colleagues and the odd manager.

(Obviously not open currently)  nice offices that are modern.   some fantastic colleagues that actually become friends.. - Will employ just about anyone - Somewhere to build experience in financial services for 1-2 years - Mostly harmless managers as long as you do your job - Decent social scene if you are young (pre-lockdown anyway) - Office building is ok I guess. The company does so much to ensure staff are engaged and the career opportunities are fantastic. Nice people, good atmosphere, lots of mobility in terms of working in different departments and areas of the business, opportunities to progress if you're willing to take feedback on board.. Learned a lot about AJ Bell products.. Offices are nice and spacious. Great fellow team members, who became a supportive family through the stressful and often downtrodden atmosphere</td>\n",

       "      <td>Generally very good life balance and hours. Fridays finish at 5 instead of 5.30 and for three months of the year you get to finish at 3pm and enjoy the summer. Last Friday of the month the company puts on free beers for staff. Also a good thing.  Generally a very good, close IT development department with many highly skilled and clever people pushing each other to expand their knowledge.  The company covers some really interesting technologies and there were opportunities to learn lots about emergent tech trends which could shape the site and various tech products in the company further. This \"give it a go\" attitude is something they should be proud of.  Fortnightly sample sales are good but over the years less good stuff was in them - I think the buyers themselves started to take anything they want home for themselves.. - Youthful staff - if you are in your 20s or 30s you'll be a good fit - Staff discount - it can save you a lot of money if buy lots of clothes - Colleagues - you can meet many decent people. Working day is 9-5pm, goes quickly and an opportunity to be somewhat creative. Looks good on cv  Great discount. good team and great culture in the company. staff discount and sample sale. All employees are treated well and respected at every level, great social environment, work-hard play-hard ethos. Despite having been around for 15 years, the atmosphere is young and vibrant and ASOS actively and successfully maintains its small-company feel.  As a technologist, working at such a huge scale is really rewarding. ASOS handles over 2 billion page hits per month and delivers more than a parcel a second to 240+ countries around the world, so the technology is vital to the success of the business.   Good people who are dedicated, motivated and work together.  Good benefits, 40% staff discount, sample sales  Summer hours - 3pm finish on Fridays from June-August!

The people.  The office is a beautiful layout. Lots of employee perks such as personal trainer, spa packages and employee sales.. Collaborative company where you feel truly cared about. I was so surprised when I joined ASOS at just how different the environment was to other places I'd worked. I already knew a few people that worked at ASOS and asked them what they thought of the company before I made my decision to join. The feedback from them was a resounding 'they really look after you' and that's exactly what I've experienced.  Opportunity to grow  quickly within the company, flexible hours and just trusting employees in general, good basic salary for the retail industry, great package, from flexi cash and bonus all the way to more niche things like bicycle scheme and holiday vouchers and having your birthday off work.  Amazing like-minded people who don't treat you as competition but as colleagues and friends, a company and brand to feel proud of, exciting things happening within the business and being able to feel proud of it.  Cool company feel and office space, awesome canteen, really buzzing and exciting atmosphere to be in.   Strong feeling that the Exec really care about the company which in return makes you really care. The CEO is in the office every day working like everyone else. He doesn't even have his own office, but sits in an open-plan amongst the rest of the employees.  The work ASOS are doing in CSR- the fact we have our own foundation and do tons of charity work is a massive plus for me. Working in a fashion company you can sometimes feel that what you're doing might not, in fact, 'really matter'. ASOS has such a focus on its charity work and every year sends its employees out to help build schools for homeless children in India, and wells in villages in Africa. They also encourage people to raise money all-year round, and are constantly organising fundraising events. It makes you feel really proud to be part of a company that focuses so much on doing good.. not to sign on at job centre. Sample sale.  Staff discount.  Summer Fridays.  Monthly Beers.  Really good people working in IT and the business!. Great company and great benefits. One of best places I worked in before certain appointments were made.

The office had a Relaxed atmosphere. Get to work with Friendly and interesting people. Good progression structure. Good parties! Great discount.. benefits are the best I have ever received. Flex bens allowance, pension etc and then the extras like the 40% discount, stall sample sales, summer hours, beauty rooms in house, fitness classes in the basement. I think staff  can sometimes take all that for granted.   social place.  Allows you to be individual and contribute ideas.   Informal work space and open environment - maybe not for everyone. Buy clothes at bargain prices.. I don't see any good reasons to work in the IT department. Asos creates a fun environment which is full of passionate people. Most people are really behind the great brand and the discount! the socials are great and the company has great ambitions. It provides a great culture for young first jobbers.. Rapidly growing organisation which is on the up, tech in particular is evolving and improving, good atmosphere, perks (staff discount!), good location..

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Friendly, helpful and hard-working colleagues. Easy to get the job even without experience in finance. Easy to get the job, Nice colleagues.. Good investment management strategy. Overall there are individual admin staff that are very nice and helpful. Free parking . Meet some nice people in the teams . Flexible hours . Benefits sickness death in service bonus if you employed for over 1 year .. I find AFH to be a caring employer, that is both adaptable to  employees' needs and prepared to listen to opinions.   Since I've worked at AFH there have been many progressive changes for the workforce in the way of employee benefits (for example, these include a savings scheme, discounted gym membership, annual company events and after-hours classes such as French and Pilates).   The office itself is a great working environment, with a friendly and open staff who make newcomers welcome.   There is ample free & secure staff parking available and the train/bus route is convenient. Staff inductions are always carried out and training needs are regularly monitored.   Progression through the company is encouraged and it's possible to change career paths internally if opportunities arise.. AFH is a great company to work for. The training courses available are brilliant, from Excel training to product knowledge, all courses are available to all staff. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming. The CEO always acknowledges you when he sees you, as do all management. We have annual staff events (summer events and christmas parties) which are a great way to mingle with staff from other levels of the office. There are a number of other pros for working for AFH such as: - discount at local gyms - Saving Schemes - family fun day bbqs - great atmosphere working the office - annual bonus - secure parking - payrise based on performance.. ...The list could go on!!  Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company.  We have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.  All in all I really enjoy working for AFH!. Big group of young people. There are opportunities to advance and progress in different directions. A great place to work with a really caring and great employer. Nothing! The whole package was completely  mis-sold. All sounded too good to be true and it was.. hours ok colleagues and line managers are really nice. Friendly people, almost like a family!. I joined AFH in December 2017 and have found them to be a truly great company to work for. On week one meetings were arranged for me with all the Senior Managers from the various departments so I could understand the different parts of the business.  There is a good positive atmosphere at AFH and you are actively encouraged to talk openly about any issues including with the CEO. The benefits package is good but just as important, you are made to feel valued and recognised for a job well done. I work with many teams across AFH and find them to be helpful and generous with their time.  Good work / life balance is also very much in evidence.. I jumped from a bankassurance world into the world of IFA and was very careful about selecting AFH as I interviewed with plenty of companies before choosing this one.  Everything they told me about themselves was true, as I found out later, and they put their money where their mouth is when they say they put clients first, which is incredibly refreshing after working for banks who say one thing and do another.  Everyone is happy to help and support you where they can, and I am left to do my own thing successfully and build my own business without micromanagement, which for me is crucial!   AFH look after their staff well,  and it's a pleasure to work for a company who you feel are working in the right way for their staff, themselves and their clients.. AFH really does pride itself on looking after it's clients and this is evident in the way it supports staff to progress with qualifications. Individuals who work for AFH get the opportunity to develop and progress if they put the work in.  Lovely office and very friendly staff.. The multiple Xmas & Summer events which the CEO's PAs spend their whole time organising.. Approachable staff Client focused Staff Benefits are increasing Great way to get your foot in the door Progression and movement is encouraged. A growing and profitable company. Flexible hours, compressed hours and part time working are all potentially available. Ability to buy and sell holidays. Reasonably diverse mix of employees at lower levels. Reasonable office facilities and friendly staff.. Working hours  Some of the people you work with My actual boss (not supervisor) was supportive and did try to make me feel more comfortable.. Great people in some places, excellent Christmas/Summer parties. Majority of the people there are lovely, and thats about the only pro. Nice environment, love people, not too stressful. -Great People -Heading in a good direction generally. Friendly, engaged, all staff members can be close to CEO with a 'family' environment. Friendly coworkers. Ready to help at any moment. Feels like a family.. Horrible experience working here. Would not recommend.. None, they lie about working hours, bonuses, projects and pay. There are none to speak of. Good company to work for   \n",

If you like working for a company that is sexist, where senior management dont care for staff and point the finger and blame others, then this is the company for you. If you want to progress, you either have to sleep with a senior manager, director or be married to them.

Some of the reviews on Glassdoor about AJ bell just do not reflect my experience of working here - Ive had good support from my manager and the HR team when Ive needed it.  I think AJ Bell has done a good job of looking after its staff during Covid.. Good social events and Christmas parties.. Good social events before Covid. Decent bonuses/ payrises.. Other colleagues and the odd manager.

Learned a lot about AJ Bell products.. Offices are nice and spacious. Great fellow team members, who became a supportive family through the stressful and often downtrodden atmosphere   \n",
       "2  Generally very good life balance and hours. Fridays finish at 5 instead of 5.30 and for three months of the year you get to finish at 3pm and enjoy the summer. Last Friday of the month the company puts on free beers for staff. Also a good thing.  Generally a very good, close IT development department with many highly skilled and clever people pushing each other to expand their knowledge.  The company covers some really interesting technologies and there were opportunities to learn lots about emergent tech trends which could shape the site and various tech products in the company further. This \"give it a go\" attitude is something they should be proud of.  Fortnightly sample sales are good but over the years less good stuff was in them - I think the buyers themselves started to take anything they want home for themselves.. - Youthful staff - if you are in your 20s or 30s you'll be a good fit - Staff discount - it can save you a lot of money if buy lots of clothes - Colleagues - you can meet many decent people. Working day is 9-5pm, goes quickly and an opportunity to be somewhat creative. Looks good on cv  Great discount. good team and great culture in the company. staff discount and sample sale. All employees are treated well and respected at every level, great social environment, work-hard play-hard ethos. Despite having been around for 15 years, the atmosphere is young and vibrant and ASOS actively and successfully maintains its small-company feel.  As a technologist, working at such a huge scale is really rewarding. ASOS handles over 2 billion page hits per month and delivers more than a parcel a second to 240+ countries around the world, so the technology is vital to the success of the business.   Good people who are dedicated, motivated and work together.  Good benefits, 40% staff discount, sample sales  Summer hours - 3pm finish on Fridays from June-August!

The people.  The office is a beautiful layout. Lots of employee perks such as personal trainer, spa packages and employee sales.. Collaborative company where you feel truly cared about. I was so surprised when I joined ASOS at just how different the environment was to other places I'd worked. I already knew a few people that worked at ASOS and asked them what they thought of the company before I made my decision to join. The feedback from them was a resounding 'they really look after you' and that's exactly what I've experienced.  Opportunity to grow  quickly within the company, flexible hours and just trusting employees in general, good basic salary for the retail industry, great package, from flexi cash and bonus all the way to more niche things like bicycle scheme and holiday vouchers and having your birthday off work.  Amazing like-minded people who don't treat you as competition but as colleagues and friends, a company and brand to feel proud of, exciting things happening within the business and being able to feel proud of it.  Cool company feel and office space, awesome canteen, really buzzing and exciting atmosphere to be in.   Strong feeling that the Exec really care about the company which in return makes you really care. The CEO is in the office every day working like everyone else. He doesn't even have his own office, but sits in an open-plan amongst the rest of the employees.  The work ASOS are doing in CSR- the fact we have our own foundation and do tons of charity work is a massive plus for me. Working in a fashion company you can sometimes feel that what you're doing might not, in fact, 'really matter'. ASOS has such a focus on its charity work and every year sends its employees out to help build schools for homeless children in India, and wells in villages in Africa. They also encourage people to raise money all-year round, and are constantly organising fundraising events. It makes you feel really proud to be part of a company that focuses so much on doing good.. not to sign on at job centre. Sample sale.  Staff discount.  Summer Fridays.  Monthly Beers.

I think staff  can sometimes take all that for granted.   social place.  Allows you to be individual and contribute ideas.   Informal work space and open environment - maybe not for everyone. Buy clothes at bargain prices.. I don't see any good reasons to work in the IT department. Asos creates a fun environment which is full of passionate people.

       "      <td>Poor salary which doesn't improve much with progression, no incentive to work harder, high turnover of staff, poor systems. Very low salary, poor working conditions, very little training provided but high expectations. Micro management are young, inexperienced and superficial girls who are not able to provide guidance and support for their teams.. Abysmal pay, around minimum wage. No actual training for your job role. No incentive to improve. training. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth when the CEO drives a roll royce and the majority of the workers are payed so lowly. The management and seniors are ruthless. No training for staff. Staff are poorly paid and virtually no retention. The consultants have no communication and despite being a \"national\" firm they can't seem to understand anything beyond Bromsgrove.. Not treated at all well after 6 yrs of being a loyal hard working member of staff . This company just pushes you out and replaces you with someone who they think is right or someone who just agrees !  It's called constructive dismissal , note to self should of took this to court !   Not sure who owns the company as the CEO seems to let the operations manager run the place ! Which nobody has respects for !   HR do not trust at all they there to help employees but all they do is protect the company !   To much work , stressful , salary low , lack of experienced staff in admin !   I would not recommend AFH to anyone Employee of choice they call it funny it's definitely not !. I am unable to find any Cons for AFH Wealth Management.  This is a great company to work for.. I cannot think of any cons for working for AFH.. Abysmal pay. Try to get away with paying staff bare minimum. Really high staff turnover.. Sometimes you have to wash up your own cup !!. Lack of support to develop. The HR team is a shambles.. i worked at their AFH Insure division, give you leads that are impossible to work.  Training pretty much none existent. Desk managers cant help as they are expected to generate their own sales and struggle to help their team to improve the overall desk revenue.  Cold calling the same people over and over again even when told not to ring back.  I spent last week ring people over 70 if they want life insurance,  or reviewing old policies.  Cancel your current policy and then take out one with less cover for more money.. Progression is hard, almost feels like the supervisors/managers dont want progression sometimes.   Pay is too low. No cons to speak of. Nothing worth mentioning at all.. None I can think of.. Too many to list unfortunately. IMO and based on my experiences there: Unless this is your first job where you get some workplace experience, don't apply.  Extremely unethical practices Senior Leadership Team are mostly internally promoted therefore leave very little to be desired in terms of how to actually run a business. Toxic culture SLT like to talk about innovation or change but have no idea how to implement or probably even want to HR team are also incompetent and I personally was privy to numerous unethical practices when recruiting.. Salary for administration staff needs to be looked into. (Extra 2-4k a year to match other companies will improve statistics). Autocratic, very much a my way or the highway organisation. Quality control an issue, with an emphasis on volume rather than quality. Largely ineffective middle management. Training and upskilling are low priorities. Some job insecurity, the company can be quite ruthless when managing out people.. Supervisor made me very uneasy from the start never introduced me to the rest of the team, not a people person and wasnt approachable. was not supportive and expects you to know exactly what youre doing even if you have never been in that sector before.. Poor pay, huge gap for pay between senior management vs those who support them, managers who bully yet you are the one driven away, lack of flexibility. Salaries are much lower than market competitors and there is no standard salary ladder, they just pay each individual person whatever they can get away with. Most of management is shocking and know nothing about how the company/processes work - or how to manage a team, young girls just go for the promotion for the higher pay but are not capable of doing any management role There is no progression at all. Management can be clicky at times. -Low Salary -Middle Management likes to micro Manage  -Staff Retention in Investment Admin team very low. Views itself as a boutique, not able to break out of a mould. IT accessories are old and cheap - monitors, mouse, etc.. Awful management  Micro management Only care about numbers and money not the happiness of their staff Happy to go against government guidelines and risk the health and safety of staff members to prematurely make staff go into the office even though people were t pleased with it- when I told them I was unhappy with the 6 days notice they terminated my contract with immediate effect for this reason  They dont care about their staff at all and if you raise an concerns or voice your own opinion they will get rid of you with no valid reason and will not follow any procedure.. -Unachievable bonus unfairly set by manager -bullying -MICROMANAGEMENT  -long hours  -no sympathy to people who travel or have children  -Manager is extremely rude and condescending -High staff turnover  -Mistreatment of staff -False promises -Lied to about job role-it was cold calling  -If you challenge management you are fired without warning or proper procedures -Do not follow covid guidelines -Poor response from hr and manager as a whole  -Insufficient workload but then have the cheek to ask you what you're doing. Borderline bullying, nepotism, overworked - steer clear. Communication between departments is lacking</td>\n",
       "      <td>Potential employees should be aware of consistently reported issues including very low pay with limited progression, high staff turnover, and a lack of adequate training.

       "      <td>Regular issues with the various computer systems, sometimes creates a perfect storm in which next to no work can be achieved. Almost non-existant progression ladder. Experience and hard work generally remains unacknowledged by management. Equally, industry qualifications seem to count for nothing. Low pay compared to similar positions in other companies. Lack of communication between management and the staff.. As managers have been there for 10 years or more, the opportunities to move up are few and far between. Like a lot of companies, directors have their favourites who will move up regardless of experience or talent.. Salary was very basic. I felt that for the pressure and amount of work, the salary elsewhere is much higher and a lot more competitive.. Will only progress if you know the right people. HR department are not worthy of being the \"go to\" for staff members as they are not trusted and underhand/biased promotions. No flexibility with hours. Hire too many \"kids\" so they can pay cheap wages - and therefore no-one gets treated like an adult or trusted. If you're not liked by the right people you're bullied out.. Not very strong work ethics especially on the team I worked, People should take a more positive approach to work and not just \"do the job\". Hard performers are neither recognised nor rewarded, not very good basic pay and enormous amount of workload within an understaffed team that's main focus should be clients.. Underpaid therefore experienced staff leave making the role harder to do. The company  should increase wages and give people incentives to stay.. Managers just give mates a job, absolutely no prospects and they will regret letting all the experienced staff leave because they are doing. Management are detached  Monotonous Ambition is frowned upon Progression impossible. Poor salary. Support to progress is non existent. There is a huge 'Face fits' culture. Poor operating systems. Training is lacking.. Parking can be an issue and there could be more social engagements available.. Very poor management and lack basic understanding of diversity.. Communication in certain situations &amp; could have higher pension contribution from the company.. Parking is an issue around Tunbridge Wells but there is ample non-resident street parking around the town and some on-site parking available to staff and easy access to rail links.. - Current building is slightly dated however we are moving to a brand new location early this year which has great new facilities including a gym and social areas.. Current office slightly dated, but with a move to a new office space in a few months, nothing to worry about.. Parking is an issue, and the building is outdated however the move to EQ4 early this year will go some way to addressing these.. Current building is very shabby, but we're moving soon. Sometimes it feels like your asked for an opinion on something even though the decision is already made. Can take a while to replace people, suspect down to recruitment policies (see 'pros' list). Pension offering not great in current market. Parking is limited but with the new site move this should hopefully be resolved.. Nature of business doesn't allow true flexible working. Benefits (e.g. pension) package not as competitive as it could be for sector. Very busy, not making full use of all facilities, but this will change as the team develops. They don't give people a fair chance, the basic HR system of aptitude tests doesn't work when it comes to employing new people or promoting those at junior levels. systems need a lot of work. None - only reason I left was they closed the Tunbridge Wells office. Very different cultures between Manchester &amp; London offices, which are not always to the benefit of the company.  The company is so driven to remain at the bleeding edge of the industry, that it ignores what it already has.  Embarrassingly poor benefits package.  Customer service could be better - you get what you pay for.. Lower than average pension contribution.  Low holiday allowance (but increases with service and buy holiday scheme).. Terrible upper management who dump things on you Promotions are very biased within the company, interviews are more for show when going for a promotion as the decision is likely to have already been made. Boring work, low pay, hard to progress, poor culture, role was not as advertised. Large turnover of staff lower paid roles. Low pay &amp; small bonuses Repetitive work Every promotion is highly competitive Some teams are managed worse than others Customer service clients are not nice to deal with Only 22 days holidays. Poor company pension - for a pension company! Astonishing staff turnover.   Few opportunities to move up the ladder, no matter what skills you have. Would rather cut corners than fix source of problems or deal with systemic issues.. Salary, although advertised as competitive, often falls short of the mark when compared to market competitors which can create a level of dissatisfaction within the workforce. Pay progression is also slow with little clarity on how to move up the pay scale. This is not helped by emails often sent by the board advertising how profitable the company is continuing to be. Despite being a relatively young company some of the views and attitudes held higher in the company can sometimes be a little Dickensian with regards to feedback and criticism.. - Soul-less working environment - Inconvenient place to work (no parking facilities and difficult to get to) - Opportunities for social or charity work only goes to management or C-level - Out-dated Working From Home policy - No trust of staff from Management and above - Promotions given based on longevity, rather than skill / experience - What they say and what they do are different  In my view, I have seen all of these things, although some apply to how other members of staff were treated, not me.. Pay falls very short of the market rate, progression is encouraged and easy if you work hard however wages barely increase.. Due to location parking can be difficult for those without a company space, although public transport links nearby are very good.. None at all from my perspective. I have no real cons about the place. What I have found is that where an issue is raised the business listen and try to react. Also, the business proactively look for concerns with an annual survey as well as ongoing communication.. Pension Contribution % is a bit low. pension contribution could be a little higher but all the benefits offered outweigh this.. Company benefits slightly worse than other places I have worked. The salary could be better when comparing it to other similar job roles. - low pension contribution - slightly lower pay than other companies. Whilst the location of the office is in an up and coming area of Manchester that is being heavily developed it can be difficult for some to access via public transport, in particular by train. A large portion of staff do however get access to free onsite parking.. None , , , ,. Low pay Low pension contributions. Car parking a joke, as its a lottery system. Culture is a big thing with The company, but in reality, it has a culture of sexism (unless you sleep with one of the managers) , bullying, finger pointing, cover ups and drinking. Might be worth the staff being breathalysed on payday Friday drinks, as staff are encouraged to drink to excess and drive home. Systems are a joke, constant IT failures, penalised by management on your bonus for not hitting your target. Management use sick pay as a weapon as to whether your face fits. HR are a joke, they dont care about your mental health, but boast on social media that they have mental health coffee morning chats available for staff, this is far from the truth as this never happens. They claim that they support the LGBTQ+ community, but in truth, the pride parade is no more than a publicity and promotional event. The toilets are unhygienic and stink. Unhygienic kitchen. So glad Im working from home at the moment. Senior management walk about the department in a bid to appear visible but they dont acknowledge you or talk to you. Its more like a power trip. None that I can think of. there are no cons currently. Salary is on the lower end of the spectrum.. Salary wise not much productive. Nothing much is negative to say. -Pension contributions -Cant think of anything else!. Pathological command and control culture. Managers completely detached from reality.  Aggressive senior member of staff using obscene language at daily stand up to describe other staff members and teams.  Manager behaving in misogynistic fashion making inappropriate comments to female members of staff and ignoring toxic behaviour within the team.  Passive aggressive HR department \"We use a Bradford scoring system, so don't ever get sick\". Bombarding everyone with pointless, endless mandatory training courses.  Ancient tech stack, rotten code base, irrational resistance to refactoring, changing or upgrading existing code.. Doesn't pay enough money etc. The training isnt always provided. started to become like a call centre. Its like a school playground. Very cliquey, unbelievably toxic environment, with harmful rumours spread and spiteful comments made if youre not part of the in crowd.. First the minor points: - Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business. - Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business - The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short. - Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.  The major failings: - HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go. - Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so theres almost a fear of being ill. - Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports. - Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But theyre seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture. - Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved.. Awful cronyism in middle to higher management. If you look the part and suck up to the right people then you can go far.. Pension contributions from employer are embarrassing. No pay rises during a year of record profits.. Poor salary, no freedom to express yourself. Wage i think is too low. Feel like one of many Underpaid to a degree. Pension contribution should be higher Bonus not the biggest Salary on the lower side for some roles Parking used to be a problem but not during lockdown. Under staffed, poorly managed, undelivered promises. You can call this AJ Hell. Pension contribution is lower than my previous employer, but the holidays and job security outweigh that.. No consideration to the staff, customer and sla is more important than any illness or mental health issue that you have, low pay for high stress job, compulsory overtime when busy, difficult to progress. Salary The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.  Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.  Management  Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed.   Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isnt which is lying to upper management.   Culture  Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams arent run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.  Promotions  Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit.   IT systems  The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close calls so it appears as though your issues are resolved.  Overall:  Good place to start your career or use as a stepping stone to advance your career.. Pay is not enough, too much work. Job stability, unpaid overtime and low bonus.. For me, not much. I would like to be paid more (who wouldnt)  but theres still good training and study opportunities.    Theres not much to the social side at the moment for obvious reasons but its good to see online events happening like cocktail making.  Theres also access to online exercise classes and PTs while the gym isnt open.. Where do we start?  After being offered the job you realise quickly youve been given a position in the  overworked scapegoat department.   Pay variance- its massive between us some admins. Although its top secret, you are not suppose to discuss what you get paid. If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if youre promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage.   You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued.   Never go against the gain- youll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime.   Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot!   Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they dont care!   Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.  MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.    Overtime- you wont get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here!   Dont appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. Im sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope.   Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like thats what your aspirations in life are!   Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.  IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk!   Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santas (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.  Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion.   HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. Its basically do as I say not as I do.. Overworked, underpaid.   Bad management.   Staff burnout because understaffing, compulsory overtime and too much business.   Cant get staff quick enough for how many people leave so pull people over from other teams.   No concern for mental health or wellbeing unless they can write a blog about it to share on the intranet or publicly.   BARELY following Government Guidelines for COVID in comparison to other corporate companies.   HR act like they are on your side but are just there to find loopholes to make your issue your problems and not AJ Bells  Managers and TLs do not listen to their staff when offered suggestions to lighten the work load.. Senior management, planning, systems, HR, pay gaps, bullying. As such a large company, it can be hard to get to know people outside of your team. Low pay for the work that is carried out Overworked staff Limited growth opportunities Management don't seem to listen to the needs of their employees. Pay could be better and the pension contribution is a little low. Some systems and processes are still developing to back up the rapid growth. Progression can be challenging within the admin departments. Salaries below external market rates Employee benefits need improvement e.g. employer pension contributions Limited opportunities for experienced people Micro management work culture No flexi-time working available Statutory minimum annual leave. Benefits package is below standard. Progression. Yes you can progress if your face fits and you don't disagree with a decision from the top. They have a habit of promoting some shockingly bad people to managers just because their face fits, never mind if they can actually do the role. It's not the case in all departments but just the majority especially customer services.  People have been told outright not to apply for promotions as they want external candidates but then hire someone internal the week after.   A fair go. The company currently utilises the government levy for apprenticeships and this includes team leader and management courses. To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.    lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug.   bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses arent assessed fairly and they vary department by department.   poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking.   Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied.   All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places.. - Piss-poor salaries. Clearly taking advantage of young workers who don't know better. No payrises across the board in a year with record profits, record client growth and record shareholder dividends. - Management is stubborn does not welcome creativity or new ideas - everyth - Insufficient resources to get jobs done within service level agreements. Approving budgets to increase headcount takes place at a glacial place by which point teams are already way behind. Place seems to be run by stingy bean counters who don't recognise that explosive client growth is going to require similar increases in headcount. - Management does not listen to valid concerns of employees and prefers to shut down viewpoints of employees who go off-script - Few opportunities for meaningful progression unless you are willing to brown-nose your way to the top - Long hours (8.45 - 5.15, why can't it just be a 9-5?). There used to be limited parking spaces for staff but this has changed with the move to more home working. Poor pay, poor pension matching considering pensions are a large part of the business, many departments are understaffed and there is pressure on individuals to cover the shortfall rather than giving teams the extra manpower they need.. Awful company to work for. Pay and opportunities are rubbish. - AJ Bell like to hire youngsters fresh out of uni or from their first job at a shoe shop with no financial experience. This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with. - AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated. - It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them &amp; make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave. - The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away. - Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management).</td>\n",
       "      <td>Numerous complaints cite low pay compared to competitors, limited career progression often favoring those \"in favor,\" and a toxic work environment characterized by bullying, lack of recognition, and poor management.  The company culture fosters a \"face fits\" mentality with biased promotions and HR failing to address employee concerns.

They want a new, interesting company like ASOS to be linked to their career and use big names of other (often much more stuffy) business to get in through the door, then pull the IT department back into the 20th century.   The worst one was a recent CIO hire who started with a statement of intent of who they are and what they want to and don't want to do. Very quickly each of these promises was broken. Even worse, heads under them were replaced by people they had worked with in every company from the past 6-10 years of their career. These people were not brought in on merit. The result was a very strong cult of personality driving people out of the company, a swelling contract budget (more mates brought in) and importantly very little credible, long term value to the business. Having worked at the company for a long time it made me sick to see such a sought after and popular company get taken in by these people.  Not unusual I know but HR really are the pits, smiling assassins but dressed up to the nines.. - Management - they had no idea what they were doing - it was a real mess and they didn't listen - Career development - the performance review process is really bad and not based on merit. Also, you can expect to be boxed into a job and not being allowed to get involved in anything else at all - Technology - messy, old, things barely work and frequently break. Tense atmosphere, newcomers are more or less ignored and not showed around properly. Far too much work to get through in one day, with low freelance rates - you're expected to work like a machine, and made to feel inadequate if there is a mistake. People seem uninterested, fake and cliquey.. Unfriendly colleagues - cliquey atmosphere Disorganised chaos of clothing in the buying department - barely enough space to get desk Managers are too wrapped up in themselves with no real idea of what is going on in their team. begins to be more corporate and more difficult to interact. bureaucracy, hierarchy, low salary, NO DIRECTION, politics, inefficiency, hr department disastrous. Some of the internal systems are frustrating to use, often required to work long hours but rewarded for hard work in other ways and always appreciated!. No BYOD policy.   Still some cumbersome systems and processes in place but getting better all the time.   It's in a listed building so the plumbing can be a bit flaky and getting a lift to the 6th floor can be a long business.. So much is going on it's a struggle for team and programmes to keep track and on top of things. Changing direction quickly and context switching is hard. IT is seen as a burden on the business.. Rapid change is great but it's hard for the resources and systems to keep ahead of what's needed. Cattiness, lots of clueless middle management. if no work got sent home or not to come in and did not get paid for this if you had any holidays you had to use them to make your pay up. As any business growing very fast there are some challenges to deal with such as not very helpful processes or some legacy technologies to improve. you may have to walk 10 miles in a shift, power hungry lower management, very high temperatures in summer 30 degrees+ , no allowed to settle in one environment constantly moved around to where workers required either receiving,put away,returns,hygiene,pick, pack, dispatch etc each with its own kpi that you have to achieve or face a disciplinary even if you have an accident you face a full investigation, alcohol and drug tests then another disciplinary, if you have time off due to genuine sickness they do not believe you and you face the occupational safety nurse to find out what you can do! If you suffer from asthma or any other lung/respiratory complaint don't bother as the dust and heat will put you in hospital.Poor Health and Safety every week there is a new regulation that you have to adhere to now we have to ware glove's for all \"dangerous\" conditions.The local doctors have two common ailments the ASOS cough (caused by the dust0 and the ASOS bad back (caused by the heavy work). Not that I can't do it I'm an ex miner but it is punishing running up and down five flights of stairs constantly!!. People have the \"I don't really care \" attitude to work No training whatsoever Outdated tools Cold office Salaries rises are given based on favouritism. One may get thousands the other pity pennies.(fact) Middle management has no management skills No room for progression Full of people bored who can't really bother hence nothing ever gets done Rules are not same for all Performance at work is an utter joke. One may get an above and beyond by doing little, though that doesn't translate into more money so why should one bother?. No real career progression and you sense the company prefers employees with no ambition so they don't complain about the poor pay and lack of opportunities. Staff are treated much like children.. Too many layers of middle management that don't fully understand what the team they are managing actually does.. Although they have some good ideas for their website and offer hundreds of products, undercover IT is a mess and at risk of falling apart. The culture is very immature and you are more likely to get on well if you stand outside the office smoking or go drinking lots.  there is  a real lack of structure and process which means they do things quickly but end up doing it twice or doing it wrong because there's a lack of clear strategic planning. the top guys are well though of, the bottom rung work hard, but those in the middle - no one seems to know what they are doing. There's a big bullying culture here. And you need to be very thick skinned to survive. There's a very high turnover for a reason. people leave without even having jobs to go to, just to get out. ASOS wants to keep the young start up mentality, but they really could benefit from growing up a little.. Progression and development.  Impossible processes &amp; systems.. Team/Department Politics, Lack of knowledge sharing across domains. The environment in the IT department seems to be that anything goes with regards to how things get done - resources poached from other teams to help get things done, last minute releases/fixes etc. Canteen really expensive Coffee shop should be subsidised. Senior management was a real challenge to engage with.  They need to do more to integrate sustainability into their core business model.. Can sometimes feel like there is so much we want to do and talk about doing, yet don't physically have the time to do it because of how fast-paced the environment is. I guess that's just down to prioritising workload.. This is my experience. If your pay is wrong there is little comeback. As regards flex hours you may be expected to begin shift two hours early at a moments notice and in spite of accumulating hours many employees' were asked to pay back hours! Ironically some were told to give back a week in overtime despite never being involved in any flex. When questioned HR would say they had access to information unavailable to Team Leaders rendering the Team Leader function a tad pointless. I feel HR didnt have control of the hours since being taken over twice. Oh and the handscanners are faulty so even though you can arrive in the car park 15mins early, by the time you use the clock in system inside it can reset and then go past the time expected in by a few seconds. Then the company charge you 15mins of pay for lateness. Targets are so high you can only achieve them by nearly breaking your neck, and if you have an accident you jeapordise employment. Good employees are treated like something on the bottom of your shoe, the lazy ones do well amazingly. Shift Managers waltz around like the second coming but I had no respect for the ones on despatch pick or pack. A Team Leader on Nights was the only one I respected but he's gone. Shame as now he has gone we have no one who takes us seriously, or treats us with dignity. Poor employer to work for.. Middle management politics! Too many contractors in IT for a very long time. Too many people trying to protect their own programs instead of looking at the bigger picture.  PMO could be utilise a lot more. Less politics and more direction leaders is needed.. CTO has issues. Either your part of his inner circle or he has no time for you. He knows best. Breaks the rules according to what suits him ( some very unethical ones) .Everyone else seems scared to disagree. Lost a lot of good people and will keep losing at this rate. Very political environment and rather cut throat. To survive basically dont challenge and query.. Too many Heads of Dept and too many getting promoted for who they know not what they know. Feels like you need to be a member of the good old boys club to further your career.. High growth business Constant pressure Changing properties. Cost and time of commuting. Systems can make work a bit manual and frustrating. Communication from management could be improved. some silly behaviors - immaturity at management level but think they need some training in how to deal with certain situations.. Open plan offices are too noisy.. Amazingly immature management. Whole IT team has talent in playing blamegames. Unethical behvaiour. Has a lack of direction, the company has many good ideas but due to high turnover at the top the plan is constantly changing. This can be frustrating for those wanting to see projects through to the end. It also means that you will work long hours. Whilst there are some great people there is also a lot of politics at the top.. The fact that its rapidly growing and evolving means it's a fast paced environment which may not suit everyone.. You're expected to put in very long hours and be on call 24/7.  The senior teams are very particular about who they favour and if you're not one of them, then you wont progress.  Other people in the business would go behind your back if it means they can get ahead.   Promotions are not based on value add to the business or quality of work. Flirting is seen as an acceptable way to win promotion.. I worked in the Customer Care team in London which was consisting out of 12-15 people from 5 different countries. We were the special advisors. My country team consisted of 3 people. One colleague was always listened to but us other 2 we were treated very special-. Throughout the whole team information was given only to the people who were good with the manager. we had 2 swaps within one year- the first leader really convinced me to speak about  if i would have a problem with my colleague. i said no cause I think these things need to resolve themselves -but he asked me in every one to one about it so that i thought he is interested and then I said what i do not like. Then the whole thing started. it broke up our team- instead of resolving it was always belived this one apparently only one knowledgeable member of the team and I feel betrayed for having said anything. Kept quiet went on working, Teamleader swap - became worse- the whole situation evolved again and that special person in our team got attention and everything and even in meetings with i higher perosn from the department the problem was not solved! It intoxicated my whole last months at ASOS becuase u felt like 2nd class people. Also in my reviews silly excuses were found that I do not reach the WELL DONE you need in order to be acknowledged or move to a different department whcih was my goal. I was not well done because I did a gap between a hiven and a capital letter and stuff like like this . I was always punctual or even over punctual at ASOS but even that meant nothing. The special person could be late 4 times a week ( yes we started counting and noted stuff) and they had always more cigarette breaks than others. Even behaving acc to the rules the next comment in my review was: You are better but still not welll done. No comment why on how instead poking on being sick one day! Was really not fair- felt useless with my colleague after a while and why they need us if the other person is so GREAT! This person btw was reluctant to show us stuff and always with a sigh and when I complained about it.they made a fuss ! Sorry for all these comments but I had a hell of 8 months there ( 3 were ok) and I seeked help but there was no support. and I want to make clear that this happened for Customer Care Specialists only! I love ASOS and what they offer to their employees really- by far the best I have seen. I left with a helpless sad and positive eye! I did not really want to leave but I needed to get out it affected my personal life and confidence.. can be all consuming...manage your time well and you will get the rewards. - Politics at senior management level - IT Changes are sometimes rushed through without proper testing - Turnover in I.T., there are some really good people who left. - Some teams/people can be quite clicky. team building activities could help with that.. Feedback not accurate Consistently criticised and not praised for what is done right Just a head's up, they will say \"can we have a chat?\" Take you off the floor for a couple minutes in front of everyone then tell you you're fired and have someone collect your things and literally show you the door. Happend to 20 people in the same day from different teams. The job is not secure considering most people who were being \"let go\" were only there for 1 or 2 months. Even being 1 minute late 3 times can cause you to be fired. You've been warned.. - not global thinking enough sometimes - sometimes fun comes before business! - workload is mad not giving you much time to think or be strategic on occassions. catty, negative towards assistant levels, a lot of overtime, lazy assistant buyers. - There's not enough space - desks are small and meeting rooms are always booked out - Things change...A LOT. I wouldn't recommend ASOS to someone who is not flexible or someone who doesn't like change - It can get very intense, it's busy all the time but mainly because people are really passionate about what they do. If you are a beginner in Customer Care rules are very strict. - Political - Unprofessional - Infantile - Arrogant - Treacherous. kpi is too high,no union on site,management don,t care about you,threat you like a slave,it is too long the list ,so if you can avoid this companny,they don,t care if you go or stay,you are only a number for them,. Over worked and under paid. Expected to work 12 hour days without  recognition or reward. I faced bullying from my manager, who made my life a misery by constantly putting me down and funnelling  her stress onto me and basically made my life hell. I reported her to HR but they didn't resolve anything.  Basically.. if you get on with your manger and he/she gets on with their manger you will be fine. if not you will have a tough time.. Upper Management and the way decisions are taken could lead to disappointment. Busy supervisors could/should be more present for their subordinates Long hours. overstaffed, weak members of staff. Poor middle management Inexperienced Team Leaders with poor micro-management skills Promotions based on popularity contests Treated like children. the whole place, from the top down all management have a bullying mentality and will get rid of you one way or another, they say there's no do's and don't's but done believe it! thats all the whole place is, questioned if you go to the toilet or make a drink, told off for being too productive, can never get holiday, all the bad reviews are true and the good ones are from people whose faces fit or have rose tinted glasses on, the latest news reports about the warehouse are true dispite being denied by executives! customer care is exactly the same and people need to see what asos are really like and how they treat their staff!. No career progression is possible. Cannot think of any at the moment. Company is growing very fast, you will need to keep up with everything.. Bad press which is a shame as the company seems to want the best for all it's employees and if there is a problem there are plenty of people that would love to get involved to change that.. Some areas still need a bit of improvement - such as in the QA leadership and some areas of the PMO. However I believe these are being addressed. if your face fits you'll be fine.. Chaos chaos chaos...everything happening very very and too fast. People that are more then 5 years there are marked and usually do not do much...except hiding knowledge to keep the status and being untouchable.. Terrible management. Low pay. HR doesn't care about employees hence the massive turnover at ASOS.. - Salaries aren't great - Big pushes to improve systems don't address underlying problems - Mostly a chaotic ride - Massive turnover of the best people - Layers and layers of tech debt (bad SQL, bad VB, countless architecture re-starts).. - not enough flexibility on dates of holidays - if you live in London, the commute is tiring  - you don't have your own desk. No progression - Colleagues allowed to get away with not working to standard. Inconsistent management, cliquey and often juvenile peers, lack of structure, and the HR team make far too many mistakes without ever fully resolving. Shift work, with a strong emphasis on conflicting early/late patterns.. - Maturity - Efficiency - Nothing else I can see. Wouldn't suit you if you don't like change and a fast pace. It's hard to move up the ladder. Compulsory 1 year needed in your role before you can move departments, even if you're skilled.. development is a little slow as it's a very set structure. Long hours!. Honestly i cannot think of any cons to working for ASOS that i have had even under the most stressful of times such as the site being down everything is handled amazingly and there is no real blame just learning experiences.. There's not quite enough space for all the new people but they're working on it. Also, sometimes being a big company makes it hard to get things done as quickly as they could be.. Useless and incompetent HR, no room for internal promotions, overstaffed, hot packed office, lots of politics, poor working conditions, too much lying.. Slow progress within the company. No real management support.. Questionable appointments to team leader roles, to say the least. This side of the company was expanding fast, so I can appreciate the need to fill the roles quickly, but it really was a case of whoever applied for such a role were either given it or asked to fill the role in probation form. It's great that they tried to promote from within, but some of the people were just not suitable for managerial type roles. It's as simple as that. Also towards the end of my time, they began to start taking privileges away from staff, in the name of efficiency. Not the way to motivate your staff or get them on side.. Slow Progression, but you do get there eventually The pay can be quite low. The workload can be very stressful. Stressful  Workload  Wage lower than work put in. - management - have to be a member of the 'old boys club' to get promoted. It's not the easiest place to work. It can be frustrating  at times and the turnover of staff is high.. 8 emails per hour target isn't always achievable - you can get a disciplinary for repeatedly having a low email average over shifts.   Progression can get political; managers know who they want to help.. Oppressive work environment. Unrealistic targets. Constant monitoring. Having to walk excessive distances of over 8 miles a day.  Not enough water stations. Timed toilet breaks.. Big company with lots or red tape and politics, mismanagement within team, hard to progress, favoritism, work can be monotonous at times.. - The job gets very repetitive  - Shift work. It's bad because the team is so young and not enough experience.. Working in Tech from a management/employee perspective is awful. There are a handful of really good managers who care about their staff. However, the others are simply greasy pole climbers who want to dine at the CEO's table and will do what it takes to get there.   There is no clear direction regards where is Tech is going. A likeable CIO has been unluky to have inherited a group of children to guide him. Am not going to mention names but avoid and Enterprise Architecture like the plague as it has caused more problems than solutions and if you want to commit career suicide, join Service Operations. A truly rank function that wouldn't know its backside from its elbow.. Huge Building so can get lost and IT Support can be delayed due to size of company but not really a 'con' - shows how well the company are doing !. extremely boring and stressful job bad management experience. Dispite the rules and processes Management use the egos to make up different one and contradict each other. Underqaulified and lazy Mangers some mangers are too scared to pick up the phone to call customers regarding their complainants and adviors have to do it. Managerment will shout and talk down to adviors.  A lot of offices politics. Staff can be very Cliqy as every one knows each other and some have generations of the family working there.  The old office was very dirty. You have to sale you sole to progress and for some that still isn't enough. You will be promoted for exerimental processes then demoted.. management to ridge, way to much inter office politics. Pay could be a lot better.. Myself and several others I know, have had a terrible experience with bullying here! The name calling, nasty remarks, rumours and career progression sabotage doesn't just stop with other customer advisors, some of the team leaders and senior staff also enjoy getting involved! During my ordeal here, I suffered with workplace depression, this was just labelled as attention seeking or drama. If I, or others tried to confide in management about the bullying it would just result in victim blaming and you'd be seen as the problem! An older team leader would often send inappropriate messages to young advisors, I too received these and was later pestered for a date. I was treated badly and humiliated here right up to the end of my last day. It really was awful! After leaving, I needed counselling for depression and anxiety. I am still affected by the experience now. I have heard from remaining employees that the bullies have found new victims and so it continues.. Sometimes stressful,  very often short handed. - The company is massively expanding so there are some building works going on at the moment. Expected to work very long hours. My team wasn't very well managed and failing badly which resulted in a bad atmosphere and limited support. being managed like a child - although a lot of are young.. Some staff very careless due to trying to hit high targets.. Not always room for career progression it can take a while to progress to next level.  Flexi time isn't really flexi time as it has to be agreed in advance. - becomes more and more corporate - new management coming in is attempting to turn it into M&amp;S - no chance for internal career progression. No progression. Need to be popular have things. High turn over. Salary is not great, although it's adequate if we consider the benefits. Sometimes there are a lot of bureaucracies and a bit of disparity between teams in the technology department. Deadlines are sometimes not realistic and quality can suffer because of that.. - Rapidly expanding company so culture shift is happening, but that means more responsibility on people to self manage themselves and their careers (so not really a con but still watch out) - Not much governance and processes in place so larger projects tend to be frustrating to work on. At the moment there is quite a bit of building works on the office to cater for the expanding workforce, so it maybe noisy at times.. - Not as agile as it could be, although continuously improving on that front. - Teams still lack autonomy.. Takes forever to progress, workload can be really intense, low pay. You are expected to work well beyond your contracted hours and made to feel bad if you leave work on time- I was asked on several occasions so come in on the weekend to work for no extra money/time in lieu!! It is extremely fast paced and as the company is 24/7, you are expected to work non-stop without any flexibility. The pay generally is also very poor considering the size of the company and competitors out there. Recruitment process was also poor- people got hired because of WHO they know, not how good or qualified they are.. Have to switch shifts all the time, sometimes working until 11. Constant monitoring, system is like school. The targets they set are unrealistic, you should do a certain amount of emails/live chats/social an hour and it just isn't possible some days. One to ones you have every week with your team leader are very hard - if you make one mistake you are made to feel guilty about it and as if you are failing every aspect in life - almost a bullying tactic. The company offer no support if you are struggling or having problems outside of work. Team leaders would go missing for hours on end and therefore my team had no one to help us except the odd team leader you could find.  Most team leaders didn't have a clue about half of the policies and I feel that does not set a good example at all for new people. One last thing is keep an eye on what you say to anyone there, there are always people higher up than you watching you and monitoring you. Never discuss anything personal with your team leader or share any opinions on anything with them, they claim your conversations with them are \"confidential\" and make you feel like you're their friend, they're not. They write down everything you say and relay it all back to their management, even private things - which a company is not strictly allowed to do. All in all - would avoid working for this company.. Turnover is really high in tech, company losing great people constantly. Service ops full of corporate climbers, doesnt represent the company or brand at all. Young people wanting to move to other areas of the business or have left in general. Politics and clique groups. Where do I start? BULLYING, this place is a playground for sociopathic morons who if they see you as a threat will 'investigate' you for stirring your coffee too  many times. They will dumb you down, you can't use 'big' words their banned because they don't understand them. They treat you like rats in cages; they have colour codes for your productivity- it will start reasonable; 3 an hour and then it will get ridiculous; 10+ customers so that's live chats, emails, social the works you'll be expected to diagnose, read through the chain and notes in 2 minutes with a cherry on top, they also monitor your 'quality' so expect to complete the feats of a robot for 11000 a month after tax. They lure you in with a 700 pound bonus if you pass probation, but the jokes on you because you only get  it  6 months after passing probation! This company will have you jumping through hoop after hoop and will exploit your desire to do well. You're under constant surveillance; expect  a battleaxe to be walking around sniffing out for a DPA  breach which is just being on your phone around the computers. Once you pass your probation though you can work from home? If they let you go you will be humiliated and escorted out of the building by security.. Do not support mental health HR do not support you Some teams are very clique and use bully tactics No one to speak to when in trouble Do not train you properly if at trainee level. This is a cliquey place and cliques are kings. From day one you will understand, if the clique accepts you, and then they will set the pace for you. You won't have much choice, you will eventually succumb to what the clique dictates. If the clique doesn't like you, the backstabbing will start almost immediately and it will be ferocious and merciless. You will find no friendly soul, no person to confess your thoughts, no friend. Everybody 100% will do their best to bring you down to your knees. If you don't leave by your own accord, they will eject you.. This place is absolutely horrible. Please ASOS do not reply to this message with an automatic response saying that this is not the case. I worked there long enough to see what kind of place it is.   The advisors are constantly monitored, if you don't log in on time you will be told off even if it was a work related conversation. The weekly one to one  feedback is even worse, according to them it is our moment to shine but the truth is far from that.  They will just tak about how to improve the quality score of your response and the productivity report.   Management is really underqualified, half the advisors working there have more qualifications than them.   They didn't even let me quit in peace, management was constantly gossiping about me until the day I left. I couldn't even say goodbye to colleagues properly.. shift patterns make making plans difficult. Pointless one 2 ones each week.  New inexperienced team managers, who where out to save their own skin rather than help, didnt know the processes, so couldnt turn to them for help, when stuck in 3 live chats and need advice quickly.turnover of staff a joke. The disperance in pay between team leaders and customer service advisor, when they didnt seem to know what they where doing. if they paid them a reasonable wage, maybe everyone will get paid a reasonable wage. 3 live chats at a time. It was like being on the phone with 3 people at a time.  Awful.. ASOS have policies put in place for a reason, like most work places. There have been a few reviews about productivity/quality and what people are expected to do... ASOS expect you to try your best. Some people cant and won't understand the policies but if you have a good work ethic then you would have no problem with this as you would be doing the right thing and following the guidelines.. Not a single thing  !! - I honestly cant think of anything. Shiftwork, which isn't great for personal life - 6am- 12pm. It's not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend working here if you're looking for a 9-5 and you're not truly passionate about your role or the company's mission. This is a not a company culture where you can  'phone it in'. You can have a work/life balance here, but it's easy to get swept up in everything that's happening.. Nothing - not that I can think of anything!. Treated like school children. Training inconsistent and processes absolutely horrendous for such a large company.. - Growing pains - Promotion and growth opportunities limited - Constantly changing strategies in Tech and poor connection between Tech Leadership Team and rest of Tech team. Worse place I have ever worked in my life. They treat you like a child in primary school, the Team Leaders are absolutely useless have no idea what they are doing all they do is walk around looking for answers as they are clueless. If you want to work in a company where you want to progress DO NOT apply for ASOS as 90% off the Team Leaders have come from other companies and have not been a Customer Care Advisor before. They watch everything you do like Big Brother there will give you stupid one to one meeting which is completely pointless and irrelevant. They FORCE you to call customers even though you have told them you aint comfortable doing them as you not familiar with all the processes yet, when in actual fact its the Team Leaders job to do it. When a member of staff has been sacked or had there probation extended everyone knows about it. The Team Leader I had was a BULLY he use to shout at us when we are not hitting our targets we couldnt even book a holiday with out being questioned he wants to know why we are taking the holiday and we have to ask him for a holiday even though it has been authorised already. Also was told to kiss the top managers bum to keep my job. When you have made a minor mistake they bring you into a room in front of everyone and tell you off like a child couldnt wait to leave this company.  AVOID ASOS. Alot of office politics and favouritism. The customer care centre is poor run by ego. childish managers treating the advisors like children. You cant even go to the loo when you want. you are monitored tirelessly and patronised. There is a bery high turn over of staff.. Can't think of any cons. Team member should be briefed on the role of the intern and how they should delegate work Managers can be flaky with guidance  Competitive. Literally everything, security being horrendously tight, worked until you drop, sexual harassment to female employees, accused of being drunk, attacked by another employee.. Boring Shift It seems like a school. Unrealistic Pace/ Very 'Clique' at senior manager level. As a relatively young company it lacks the structure of other organisations, but makes up for it through atmosphere and working environment.. Prepared to be ignored if you're not part of the boys club The Tech teams are run by a bunch of bullies, it's their way or no way, even if their way is the wrong way Hard work and results are often over looked, and people are based on who they know  If you're a female in Tech don't expect to be paid anything near your (junior) co-workers. Low salary for entry level jobs. Quite informal, catty advisors to team leaders to performance managers, They lie when they say it's easy to progress. The discount was just amazing !. Not that I can think of!. I was sacked for literally being 3 minutes late when another girl on my team (white) came in late 25 minutes and was regularly late. No one said a thing to her. Manager was obviously bias and much friendlier with the white people on the team. I had been performing very well in all other areas but being one of the only ones on the team who lived a little further away I had had a few lates (max 8 mins) which I was always happy to make up at the end of the day. Shifts were terrible, your social life is non-existent with the crazy shifts you're given and they still have the cheek to constantly ask you to do more overtime.  I failed probation because of being 5 minutes late and even though the manager knew this she wouldn't tell me when I asked her at the beginning of my shift. I told her I felt sick and just wanted to know. She made me continue doing the work and said that there was nothing to worry about. My uncle had passed away the night before and by the time they finally arranged a probation review meeting to dismiss me and end my contract I was feeling very sick and I burst out into tears. They are honestly so harsh and they don't pay their employees much and try to make up for it in 'benefits'. Not acceptable.. Unfortunately people take advantage and dont pull their weight. Too much middle management Too many stakeholders Lots of politics. 3 sign off segments before being promoted. Only have opportunities be signed off twice in the year. Slow progression.. AGILE DELIVERY Managers are generally poor developers from other companies trying their hand at management. ASOS are not good at hiring good managers, I've only had one that I've completely respected and he was promoted twice, rightly so.   Poor understanding of the progression process, the skills chart has been updated so many times, no one really knows how to get a promo outside of the pub..  Facade of women in tech initiatives recently to push equality for women, when again women are still not getting equal pay. A wide spread adjustment was done very recently to try and address the difference in pay gap without mentioning exactly the reason why.. Shift work, nothing else to say. The best company I have been so far.  Hands down.. politics, made to work like robots.. Such a high turnover on all levels right to the top. That the management style , rules and office culture was always turbulent.   At time it was like a high school.. Lack of training programmes/materials Poor management. * Was not placed in the division that I interviewed for, which is absurd (and hence i did not stay long at this org) * My initial line manager was a condescending bully with numerous complaints against him * Some of the people were awful - dismissive, belittling etc. * \"Just do it\" attitude held by many managers * BIG boozing culture * Flexible working initiative not consistently implemented * The criteria for BA career progression was extremely opaque. The process was not explained during the interview process even though I very specifically asked about it * The division seemed obsessed with the process of delivery and not delivery itself; suffice to say our team delivered very little and I left because I felt this was going to look very bad on my CV * The staff turnover in tech was laughable (so high). -Politics. -Undermining and backstabbing. -Complete lack of professionalism (especially some Directors and their Mini Me Wannabes) -Heavy drinking and drugs culture (inc within the office). -Do as I say culture (dont do as I do, as I am superior)- hypocrites galore!  -Some vindictive personalities, especially within Tech -Bullying and Discrimination- discriminatory subculture exists (language and actions permeate directly from the CEO)  -Presents a holier than thou facade, everything from ethical trade to working conditions and equal ops- none of which is backed up.. It's chaotic and not in a good 'fast paced' way. It is just hugely frustrating on a daily basis.   Senior Management don't deal with poor Line Managers either.   Too many people involved in a sign off process.  Very hard to progress up through the company - there's no support from HR to do this either - so the only way to do this is leave.  For some departments, it's all about politics and egos.. The hours you have to put in are long, a healthy worklife balance isn't always possible.. - Still a corporate, things take time, lots of stakeholders. - Some incompetency in mid/senior management results in weak leadership and confusion. A lack of willingness to stand up and be counted on difficult decisions.  - The fashion side of the business often does not know what it wants, making it hard to know whether the work done will deliver any real value.  - Central teams who seem permanently unavailable, making necessary infrastructure changes near impossible, frequently blocking entire teams  - Somewhat chaotic and noisy environment at times  - Unprofessional/disrespectful behaviour in certain teams with management either participating or turning a blind eye.  - Significant unaddressed technical debt in some areas meant some teams were heavily coupled, causing significant pain in releasing.. If you dont fit in with the clique from day 1 you may as well leave. Management more bothered about hiding the truth so they look good. The bullying tactics used by MANAGEMENT seem to be the best way to get ahead.   On the outside its painted as a social fun place to work. Thats just code for drug taking and coasting through sign offs because youre part of the right clique.   Key words: backstabbing, fake, drugs, bullies, cliques, mismanagement, no mental health support, sexist, boys club, non empowering, no work life balance, poor salary.  When youre 21 and dont understand what a workplace should really be like. No one at ASOS will tell you otherwise or try to help. Not cool when its detremental to peoples mental health.. Difficult to move up with so many people working there.  Different standards held for different teams largely depending on leaders and managers. Very fast pace and changing, competition for progression. I have noting to fault about the role or the people.. No profession, can't keep up with the growth in Customer Care, don't get feedback from their advisors even though they are the ones dealing with customers every day.. Difficult to find Team Leader/Manager when there are problems so can effect performance.. long hours , can be tiring and stressful. Poor understanding of technical function and the technical director is very demotivating. - Bad leadership, very top down decisions - Central teams dictate how the platforms should work - Waterfal driven by big programs - Architecture decides everything before engaging the development teams, which at this point is too late to change. It feels like like im back in school sometimes and Id rather get more money than have drinks at work etc. theres very often no communication or a lot of miscommunication between the senior management and advisors. Theres no consistency in managing styles and there are a lot of people who should never be a part of the management.. Left on your own and hard to find help if needed. Teams are divided, if you get a good team, great, if you don't, you could experience some petty behaviour typical of fashion industries. Also you are VERY replaceable, which is a good thing too, but in my experience, people/managers didn't always keep to their word if they promised something.. - This is a retailer, not a technology company. The majority of the business sees tech &amp; product management as \"IT\".   - Product management largely sidelined due to organisational structure, separated accountability  - Fundamentally not a very evidence-based or data-driven business, but politically-driven; priorities usually set top-down by the \"highest paid person's opinion\"  - Don't seem to promote based on merit, but years experience/age &amp; politics. Results in employees' focus not being on delivering value for the business, but what politics they need to navigate to get promoted. Very often leads to incompetent leadership who can \"talk-the-talk\", but could never \"walk-the-walk\"  - Very frustrating place to work - huge opportunities that no-one is working on.  - Massive (very waterfall) change programs have slowed almost all forms of iterative development or innovation down to a stop  - Bloated, with many employees doing very little of value.  - Company takes the approach of throwing people at problems, as opposed to (usually very simple) use of technology to solve them.. Truly, cannot think of any. Hard to think of any. - Due to growth office is split in two locations.. Retail pay is atrocious, not competitive at all to my knowledge. Many people leave ASOS, go to Arcadia and come back on a higher pay grade and job title. Office politics exist everywhere so that's negligible Many levels to Promotions. Each JD is tiered: Entry Lvl 1/Established Senior To move up you must be assessed and or signed off. This happens every 6-12months in March &amp; September. If you start in Feb, or Aug you have limited time to learn the role then prove your worth. So will need to work very hard to step up 2 roles. Doing your job is not enough to be levelled up. You must be doing the role above to be signed off. You have no opp to show you can you must be already doing it. Workload can be great.. Working in the ASOS studios was one of the worst experiences of my life and badly effected my mental health. I had to suffer bullying at the hands of my team leader (who had received previous complaints prior to my employment) and handle everything entirely on my own, despite my cry for help to HR (on two occasions). It was only when I resigned that they decided to listen but even then my complaint was never taken seriously. The HR department are completely for the company and are not too concerned with the wellbeing of the individual employee. The management I was under are entirely inexperienced, socially inept and unprofessional. They are allowed to abuse their position of authority without being challenged. I'm sure many of my previous employees would agree that it is more like being back at school rather than in a professional working environment. I have heard more recently that people have had mental breakdowns working here, and I was on the verge. Don't be fooled by the amazing benefits and working culture, believe me, it's not worth it! As I've learnt, it's far more important to have a healthy working environment and supportive management with good morals than having parties and cheap clothes!. You can never find your team leader if you need help with something. They expect you to not make mistakes when you've been there a day, you are expected to hit your targets straight away and get told to hurry up if you don't. Don't even think about having a day of ill otherwise you are gone.. My employment was terminated due to a few reasons, some for not following process when I was only just taught it and one of which was a fabricated reason from a leader. It was that my behavior did not suit the requirements of the role customer care advisor and that it is not acceptable to say things like 'Thanks Mate' or  'cheers bro' to the Team Leader. There was no statements taken from either side or any investigation concluded, it was just taken as fact that I must've said it. Even though I did not know this until I was in the meeting my employment was being terminated in.  All I can say is, if they don't like you personally then they will do whatever they need to, to get rid of you. Even if that means making things up likemy leader did. They also have a negative snappy attitude towards workers but this is more due to the type of Leaders that were training my group at the time, the others seemed fine.  On the plus side the termination went smoothly and respectively.. Inexperienced management, office politics, long serving employees cruising and not adding any value. No clear career progression, information not shared. Promotion is little bit difficult. Not many cons to share. Bullying becoming more and more common with a growing blame culture and unfriendly teams. Management promoted on their technical skills and constantly lack the ability to step up manage their people. Lots of cliques and catty behaviour. HR are disorganised and ignore any real issues. They will always side with the most senior person in the room. Work life balance is non/existent- if you are given the rare opportunity to work slightly fewer days you are expected to still do your full time job in that time....with less pay. Health and well-being is promoted as important to the company but realistically they will ignore any problems and class it as underperformance.. Bad communication, lack of career progression paths. No cons, the IT department is broken down into smaller teams. Every team varies.. You get some feedback when you did something wrong about the process. Sometimes, it is kinda of tricky as the processes changes all long. They are attentive to employees feedback.. Monotonous tasks, job is very boring and repetitive. Long hours (I work nights, 4 on 4 off).. No bonus sometimes long hours. I dont really have any cons to be honest. Job progression, salary, very different to other businesses. Bad pay, they play on their benefits. Takes a ages to get promoted.. sometimes felt like it was a huge organisation perhalsp bigger than i am used to, which is purely personal. obviously the company could afford you the same opportunitties if it wasnt so large, not sure if its a con as such - more that it said i had to fill this out. Retail sector is volatile, pressure, stress, competitive atmosphere, unrewarding work (personal opinion). The only thing - far from London center. Hot desking Little progression Quiet office /awkward. the building is old and uninspiring but is currently being  refurbished!. ASOS has built a great business as a marketing  x IT business. As a result there is a monolithic tech presence organised around platforms not customer needs, preferring to take a shopping list of features than explore an ambiguous space and test and learn their way to creating true customer value.   In many ways this is a corporate IT structure from 2005.   The organisation remains heavily  siloed and the suggestion of cross functional teams working towards a metric-focussed outcome is treated with suspicion by tech leadership. One suspects because it threatens their power base.   There is a strategic vacuum at the top, meaning everyone decides what they think is important. This changes on a weekly basis as plans go out the window to chase short term wins.  I'm ultimately frustrated I couldn't do more to establish a different way of working but it was a tough sell in this environment I guess - you can lead a horse to water.... Theres a lot of support and maintenance which makes a developer bored  The office is too busy and noisy  Not enough writing code. Big corporation with a lot of management.. - People talk behind your back  - No room for progression unless you are friends with a lot of the TLs  - No support  - TLs are under the age of like 21 and have no clue what they are doing  - The wrong people progress. lack of real innovation, mismanagement of resources (financial, people), short sighted as to  the industry future, focused on short term sales, general fear of doing new things, london-centric mentality,. Too much stress for such little pay. No recognition for all your work. Everything went to the managers favourite member of staff. Not enough support from management and HR. Had to leave due to being too ill from stress with no help or contact from HR even though they said they would. Rude and arrogant management - They knew they were higher than you.... Very catty!!! I expected this as its fashion but not to that extent. Felt like I was back at school. No exit interview to ask how they could improve.. shows they didn't care how and why I left. All talk and no actions. Extremely over worked. From the outside ASOS seems an amazing company as everyone only posts the fun/ exciting things about ASOS but its not true.. This are very slow to release. when money is tight there are people doing 3 peoples jobs and people who deserve to be promoted aren't. Need to listen to the people in mid level positions more before making decisions which impact their job on the software they use. Also need to remember what people are inspired by, using all money for certain events where we're unsure of the purpose instead of salaries doesnt feel right.. -Gender pay gap -Promotions structure is not clear at all, women especially dont get the same opportunities  Very strong underlying sexism culture  they have allowed harassment and bullying  Completely unsupportive and disgusting treatment if you suffer from mental health(they will likely reply to this with a whole copy and paste job about how they dont tolerate sexism and they support mental health, DONT believe the hype) I am not the first and i wont be the last woman to leave because of it!Despite their shiny image and many benefits HR will always put senior management first and not take lower down employees opinions seriously. Its a very toxic work environment.   I strongly advise not to work in technology here or ASOS in general. I worked here for over 5 years and really gave it a chance but ASOS did not ever really change their ways. There are way more tech roles in London where you will be valued, respected and rewarded. Dont be fooled by the first 5 glass door reviews on here that are all positive most likely and written by ASOS HR, dig a little deeper and take on board the real honest reviews.. Everything is a Con! I don't even know where to start. No chance for career growth, especially for non english speakers. You are treated like a kid. There are so many problems within each market and the management just pretend everything is ok, they don't work to help costumers but just to look good to the CEO eyes. Over hiring: there are many many teams that do NOTHING all day or all night long, but they keep hiring people from outside so the good employees only have to leave. I will never understand why they do this. Constant hiring of mediocre people while they should only keep the good ones. They also keep creating new teams that absolutely make no sense. Micromanagement: Team leaders need to act like kindergarten teachers because their workload is ridiculously low so they just wonder around telling everyone off it they look at their phone or if they speak in another language, they really do not know how to keep busy.. - Your rights are exploited: - you get in trouble for using the toilet for longer than 5 minutes! this will also get used against you for reviews.  -get in trouble or sacked if your off sick -get in trouble or sacked if your late even though you have legitimate reasons.  -if your going through personal crises the team leader will use it against you to get rid of you.  -a lot of favoritism happens here. Unless you are kissing the team leaders back side you won't pass probation or progress.  there are some really good staff there who have been in the same position for a very long time and they are not progressing simply because the team leader and manager doesn't like them as their personal favorite pet.   -many of the team leaders don't even like doing their job - which is to help and aid staff! they want to just sit there and gossip.  -staff are young and immature, no good worth ethics and use passive aggressive attitude to get their way.  -lie on feed back forms. some information even get erased.  -it's like being in prison. You get told off for the most ridiculous things.  -Most of the team leaders and managers apply rules to staff they don't abide by.  -working on rota and weekends can really exhaust you. the pay is not worth it. -people end up feeling depressed there -poor ventilation and poor hygiene practice. Sometimes promotions are up to financials (even though the company has a VERY stable financial background) Mobile development is not agile, more like waterfall There are no feature squads, but teams are made from homogenous members (a team is all web devs or android devs for example). Cant think of any, fast paced and a lot of work like any job worth having.. Low wage, shift patterns that change weekly. Hard to progress. Shift patterns.. Do your physical and mental well-being a favour and avoid ASOS like the plague.   As a company, theyll go to any length to protect their precious public reputation and to scaremonger their employees to avoid word being spread of the evil and vindictive work culture that goes on behind the scenes in their offices.  When you start your job with them, youll be sold a dream of an employer that values their staff, drives personal development, as well offering great benefits e.g. staff discount, free onsite gym membership, monthly free alcoholic beverages on shift etc (which youll end up relying on, to help you cope with their diabolical management), but it doesnt take long before the cracks begin to show in their cleverly executed facade.   Youll have their company values to be Authentic, Brave and Creative drilled into you from the get-go, yet youll find yourself penalised and labeled as a troublemaker if they dont like what you have to say.   Progression and promotion opportunities arent rewarded to the loyal and hardworking employees, instead, theyre given to those individuals that spend all of their time gossiping with and sucking up to Team Leaders on company time, rather than doing the work theyre being paid to do.   Passion and dedication to your role go unnoticed, but theyll be quick to reprimand you for getting up from your desk to grab a glass of water, being a few minutes late back from your break or lunch or god forbid being off sick when you are unwell. This results in extremely high staff turnover and leaves people feeling deflated and unworthy. The number of staff absences related to mental health issues triggered by the workplace is at an all-time high.   In July 2018, ASOS signed the Time to Change pledge, stating they are committed to supporting those with mental health conditions without judgement and yet on returning to work, you are asked patronising questions in a formal documented interview, designed to make you feel guilty and ashamed, such as Do you understand the impact your absence had on the business?, which sounds extremely judgement if you ask me.   If the management at ASOS had an ounce of compassion for their employees, theyd realise that they are not robots, so they shouldnt be treated like one. Its about time that they open their eyes and use their ears to start actually listening to the feedback of their staff and addressing the serious flaws within their working culture before its too late.. shift work, busy, loud office. progression has slowed down a lot recently. Good company i dont see any cons. shifts, middle management, inconsistent pay. Whilst interviewing the company tells you how much they like to push their employees and how much space to grow there is. However if you work for the office in Watford you will have have almost no chance to move up and change to the London office, even if your skills are amazing, they rather hire externally. A lot of talented people get stuck there and can't build their career the way they wanted.. Many people who work here suffer a decline in their mental health. This is known and ignored by management. Long hours, pay just above minimum wage. This is the kind of workplace that makes you work the job that you're aspiring too for 18 months to 2 years before they take your applications seriously. If you do get a promotion you'll be working alongside external applicants who get paid more than you however have little to no understanding of how to do the role meaning internal applicants get paid less to do more as they have to pick up the slack.. Lack of diversity in management.  Gender pay gap.  Shareholders are more important than employees.. was there for a few months and was sent home because of lack of work at least 1 or twice a week was bad when you travel for over an hour to get there and only work 2-3 hours.. Feel like your in prison. With the strictness on being late after lunch or break by even 1 minute.. Shift patterns can be unrealistic for your body clock. If your a minute back from your lunch its like you have committed a crime. You have to ask to go to the toilet which they monitor. No progression. Poor pay.. long hours strict management racist mangers not enough money same music everynight. Bad communication  School like environment  Patronising Managers  Treated like a child  Repetitive  Low salaries. The social aspect of the company is being cut drastically, with no more xmas parties and cutting benefits such as discounts. None at all what so ever. Mediocre pay, not very stimulating, extremely process driven. Poor for development if you are at a lower level as they do not allow you to take any further responsibilities which means you can never learn/ gain real experience until you go to a different role somewhere else or stay in the hopes someone will leave and you can apply for their job.  Communication can be poor and often feels like you voice is not heard.. Redundancies happening everywhere - at a moments notice. Interview process was slow.. Management and the amount of pressure they put on you. Shift patterns were long.. Lack of management internally  promised bonus and not received. Culture and benefits are changing a lot, not for the good either! Cutting back is evident, which effects the employee experience. High staff turnover which can be off putting. Pay and discount, work environment is fun. - unprofessional, racist management - lack of structure and policies - no clear guidance on progression - not customer oriented - cool kids club  - lies used to lure people into the business - minimal sick days - horrible pay - terrible connection to leavesden - lots of pressure on advisors and staff - overcrowded building - terrible canteen food - drug culture - uneducated managers and no support - a joke of HR (people team) their HR advisors are not trained and everybody sat in their will give you a different advice, instead of speaking to each other and advising one  or the same advice - hypocritical behaviour e.g. asos advocates for gender equality, not racially motivated etc. but are the worst when it comes to racist jokes, sexist remarks and homophobia. Salary is way below market rate, and the way promotions work resemble a popularity contest.. Once you've 'learned the ropes' the work isn't challenging, most of the hard problems have already been solved and much of the work is boiler plate rinse and repeat.  If you're looking for pure software development then you may be disappointed, the software engineer role is more DevOps so much of the job is scripting and managing configuration where much of the job is spent in a web browser battling the tooling (although there are initiatives to solve this long term).  Not all the work is greenfield, much of the system is still in 'legacy' and thus you'll be dealing with horrible big balls of mud, but this is part and parcel of most companies.  They are very slowly trying to migrate to cloud based solutions but this process will take several years.. Overcrowded workplace where often some people are bringing their personal feelings and willing to deal with arguments from outside inside of a workplace.. There are so many changes happening at ASOS that its hard to keep up. Director has very little knowledge of the business, very little knowledge of what garment technology at ASOS entails, is very impersonal and extremely demotivating. They has made so many changes to GT that it is no longer representative of garment technology as a whole - it seems as though GT is being phased out all together. They've made so many wrong decisions and has limited progression and removed so many processes that during their time there, we've lost over half of the original garment tech team and they are not back-filling either, meaning that workload is pilling up and techs are being signed off with stress (all of which management/HR doesn't seem to care about- no support is offered) There is not a single member of garment technology which is happy in their job.  There is little to no training given when you start - I was being trained up by other assistants who had started not long before I had.  ASOS as a whole are struggling massively, morale is absolutely terrible as more and more perks are slowly being removed. Redundancies are being made left, right and centre  and its very common to be walking through corridors/go to the toilets/walk around the canteen and see someone crying.  When I started almost 2 years ago, ASOS was a happy and exciting place to work, however have fallen onto hard times but has become very corporate (something they promised wouldn't happen) in that time, causing a lot of anger and frustration with current employees.  It's a very hard time to be working in the Retail part of ASOS due to cutting headcount and upping the option count, meaning that there is too much work to keep up with, too much for the amount of people they have.  I also have suspicion that many Glassdoor reviews which are popping up are fake.   It is hard to list every bad aspect of GT currently so the best way to describe it is: Garment Technology is an amazing, fun and creative profession to have, however, ASOS is not the place to practice that profession right now. Times used to be different but as long as they have the vision which is currently being rolled out, you will not be respected or be happy as a garment tech there. Perhaps in a few years, things may improve, but right now, I wouldn't bother - for your own happiness, mental health and career.. The promotion scheme is deceiving: you can nail your objectives and it doesn't guarantee you a promotion whatsoever; \"well done, maybe next year\". The web team is crippled with managers and technical figures that are long past their prime. Product teams, design teams and development teams work in silos, making the everyday completely uninspiring.. Poor retention of staff, senior management chaotic.  Long hours, grown too quickly and lacks good working practices.. Young unexperienced employees are given carte blanche festering bullies that will do nothing good for your career and making your expertise and energy worthless, The HR department called PX is the most unhelpful department. Young admins are the gateway to nowhere. Overall the company values look great on paper but the reality is completely different and very disappointing. Feels like school  Inconsistency  Poor communication.. Lack of communication from the top to the bottom. Lots! expectation of delivery remains constant even though the numbers have gone down.. Management becoming more like Arcadia, reducing benefits. Reaction and change - working in a fast paced and changing environment is to be expected in any growing company but ASOS tried too quickly to grow itself. A 'chuck money at problems' attitude.  No confidence when collaborating with other members of the team leader community due to lack of management by their manager or experience.  Nepotism is rife within customer care and most 'support' teams are made up of friends who've been given free reign to offer roles to those who have zero experience.  Development opportunities are more of a popularity contest than of deserved applications - which shows in the recent cull of people at management level. There has been a restructure due to business issues which has seen over a hundred people made redundant due to bad business decisions made the last few years.  No-one ever really seems to be pulling in the same direction - too many members of management have difference of knowledge but not in a positive way (this is down to too many senior management only having knowledge of ASOS as a business - which is an issue since the customer care department has grown).  Very specific, but the term 'perception is reality' being used by high level management as a way of judging people's ways of working or personalities within their roles. This is frightening considering the amount of people that work within customer care.  Rumours, bitchiness and college-like feel about the place is the absolute worst. It is like being back at school (that's just the management).  The current CEO.. You don't get a discount when purchasing online as full-timers do.. Terrible management Stupid processes No opportunity to growing up. business has grown faster than the leadership and infrastructure. Very little progression and pay rises.. All other events are cancelled, which includes: Christmas parties, summer parties, Friday drinks and other engaging and fun activities No free fruit Poor communication between departments, you will never receive an answer for anything, new processes are sloppy and not well though through. No opportunity for progression or growth, due to recent company cutbacks.  All vacancies have been removed No certainty about anything Overconfident management, who are not even competent to do their job and just got the position, because they work in the company for a long time.. Massive workload, feels unmanageable at times Difficult to progress Competitive. Incredibly inexperienced senior managers, who are not qualified to do the role they were fortunate enough to be quickly promoted in to, right place right time approach, inherent favouritism. No structure.. better perks would be nice!. Too many people for one job, not much to do, poor mid Level management. Try to mould you into the same people. Say theyre flexible working are not in practice. very clique within teams,  personal development has become less of a focus over the years.. Many middle managers just don't do much or have any impact. C*O to this day is the most boring person I've ever met. I avoided going to any of his meeting  unless I want to sleep.. Like any customer service job is ripetitive and pretty boring.. - Exec board are out of touch with most departments - Sometimes it can feel hard to get some work off the ground - Redundancies were recently enforced. The handling of this was terrible.  - Sometimes its hard to progress (speaking on behalf of myself and multiple people across the business). Even when you do, pay rises were minimal although work could double or triple.. the unrealistic targets abd bad enviroment. Work environment can sometimes be hostile and tense, friends move up to higher places than hard workers and HR and management can see the inner politics and don't really care enough to fix it. Some people are given better treatment than others based on who you are friends with. Many people have left recently after being driven out by these tense and stressful working environments.. Lots of legacy systems, but that could also be a unique challenge for some. The company is currently going through a lot of change which can be disorienting.. tied very closely to MS stack. not much growth for architect overlapping roles and responsibilities causes friction between engineers and architects.. Not a lot of communication with the contact centre managers.. Management reduced the amount of benefits due to latest market results. Not allowed any breaks when you go to the toilet you have someone follow you too make sure your not having a break  some staff are ignorent and don't speak to you including management. Being  scrutinised for being a couple minutes late to work/break/lunch. Feeling like youre in prison. The fact there are some team leaders that think they can act as they please and when you do make a formal complaint, it doesnt go anywhere. Instead they fire you for it and give you some bs reason, like your performance isnt good enough. God forbid youre sick or have some personal problems going on, they dont care. They never really acknowledge the good youve done, they focus on the bad. I personally believe that some people have some sort of God complex about themselves and I honestly believe some of the people there have suffered some sort of a traumatic experience because the way they treat you its as if youre the reason for their pain, so you should suffer.. Challenging commute from central London. unethical progression based on favouritism horrible hours work every 2 weekends in a month makes you brain dead. some people pull their weight more than others.. Uninspiring and removed leadership.. Salary, no career progression. No career progression to manager role. Feedbacks are not always welcome, and when they are with data and analysis, not taken in consderation. No flexibility with shifts Canteen with not very healthy food. Many benefits being removed.. High level of mico-management, not much flexibility. Clogged with rude, unprofessional lazy middle managers. A lot of hardworking talented people at the bottom who have no opportunity for progression. No pay rises for 2 years (unless youre management). All the company perks have either been removed or had restrictions placed on them. People crying at work everyday. Forced to work overtime unpaid regularly. Workplace is a health and safety nightmare, people severely injured at work, Asos weasel their way out of it being their fault. No one wants to be there.. -Terrible pay  -gender pay gap  -poor management  - bad sustainability  -no progression -high staff turnover. beirachracy was a bit too much. No Fixed shifts Working weekends sometimes. Not great pay, hard to get promoted or make a difference.. Terrible shift patterns left me tired all the time and affected my relationships. Upper management does not have a clue.. Progression is extremely slow so you dont feel appreciated. Management doesn't know/care what's going on in teams, and salaries are far below average.. Senior management make frequent bad decisions. Pay not aligned with industry rate, across all lower levels. Sizeable wage gaps. highly corporate environment and lots of meetings. Too many to mention. too much micro managing no flexibility on lateness management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising shift patterns are pretty bad, knowing a sizeable amount of people commute in from London via public transport. no opportunities for progression within, lack of functions to manage team, lack of basic kpi's (removed and new ones not fully introduced at this stage: 6 months later), serious lack of support from senior management, no training / no development (1 year in role), no accountability on poor performance, false promise of salary reviews, ... , most recently removal of employee benefits. Discrimination towards language teams Very difficult progression specially if you arent English Management lies and unqualified Salary is basic and salary reviews very little They hire teens with no work experience or work ethics Redundancies are often. Treated like a school kid by higher ups. Poor organisation. Poor Communication. Un-motivating place to work. Alot of changes going back and forth.. - Pay could be slightly higher - Hard to develop and progress as employment is slowing down. Lack of leadership on teams from more junior manager roles, more corporate than before Workload. The line manager was always on holiday despite knowing I was just a starter.  Lack of training given. Make it as hard as possible for employees to progress and hire externally when they have plenty of capable staff already in their employ. pay could be more, could have more recognition for hard work. To stressed, ridiculous targets , and team leaders are bullies. Procedures are always changing and contradicting. The company wants blood out of you. The company is very dodgy and tries to cover its tracks very strategically. Racism still exists in this company if I could rate no stars I would.. Space for growth for your career feels limited. Nothing other than workload can get a bit heavy at times, would enjoy a better work life balance. - Poor internal communications - Asos is a place where management are terrible at cascading information that you need to know down the hierarchy. This could  be staff moves , supplier /relations. This will make you feel not important. - Poor systems - well at least in my role, you will have to do everything on massive excel sheets which are on the verge of crashing your computer down any moment. Asos needs some investment in retail systems - regular emerging last minute deadlines that could easily be planned into the critical path - emails are frequently sent with deadlines due in shorter time than it takes on average to complete the task causing a frenzy which breaks down the document that needs to be filled in - poor attitude to mental health - management haven't been trained adequately on dealing with employees whose mental health is worsening and the risk it poses to Asos.  For example when a manager was told that someone on their team is suffering from poor mental health because of things going on Asos they privately berated them for not having what it takes to work at the company and excluded them for being up for any promotional opportunities.. An extremely hierarchical company with thousands of employees, can feel like you are just a cog in the ever expanding ASOS machine. There is very much a \"wait your turn\" culture so although there are opportunities to progress, you had better get in line. Senior management certainly talk the talk when it comes to ensuring employee happiness but ultimately day to day I found the culture very cut-throat and certainly experienced elements of bullying.. Slow progression, low pay.. over work and underpaid, little opportunity and benefits continuously stripped. Reduction of perks over the last 2 years (xmas party, friday drinks, free fruit, reduction of staff discount). salary is bad, no clear progression to move up.. Low salary  and expensive food  in canteen. highly unprofessional and would not recommend at all. Heavy workload, sometimes impossible. Internal communication in some areas has completely disappeared leaving employees feeling in the dark, unsupported, wary of leadership. Atmosphere has become secretive and at times hostile. A series of poor decisions has eroded the great culture and atmosphere had been built. Huge turnover and loss of talent. Inconsistency between business areas.. The parties and some of the people. Lots of promises of development and progression that never come to fruition. Inconsistencies  with management methods.  The salary is not competitive.  Put the night staff through redundancy twice in 6 months.  If your face fits, you progress.. Management style sometimes very challenging. No benefits, low opportunity for development, company in crysis. No care about employees  Awful salary  No perks  Crazy hours. Work procedures are not suitable for certain markets.. Company in crisis Salary is not competitive Very limited opportunities for progression. I no longer work there. Change in focus, lack of reporting,. Abhorrent and humiliating HR processes Severe lack of care and understanding for their people Horrendous lack of development opportunities Poor decision making from top level which has cost hundreds of jobs Poor data management and reporting capabilities for a global company. Very strict and controlling on work completed. Extremely fake, gossipy environment, a lot of bullying going on. Buyers get away with anything they want, come in late all the time, talk to you as rude as they like. Its one rule for them, another for you. You could be late a few times in one week and and theyll pull you for a chat. But dont even think about mentioning theyre late nearly every day. Dont complain to anyone above them either, or ask to move teams as youll get fired, they are all close. HR do nothing to help or support you but team up, and make up a scenario with these people to get you fired. They wont even follow the correct disciplinary procedure, even when you have passed probation. I was the most hard working person on my team staying until 8pm most days, but it was never appreciated. When they fire you they will say you stayed late because you came in late, to try and make themselves look better, when you was hardly late at all.   Do not even think about showing an interest in a different area of the business, like they promote to you at interview. They will fire you for not having passion for your role. I tried to network and ask current employees how to get experience for the role and was told that was wrong, even when the replies were helpful. I asked the interviewer for advice on how to get experience after not getting a role and I was repeatedly ignored when all I showed was extreme passion. This will also get you fired because they will complain it made them feel uncomfortable. They wont just reply to you like a normal human being would, and put you at ease, thats clearly too much for them to do as a manager.  When youre getting dismissed they will list extremely pathetic reasons to make it look more legitimate. Even things that happened before you were at ASOS, because their source on information doesnt know all the facts. Never trust anyone, when they want you gone, they will use everything against you. I dont know how ASOS get away with treating employees the way they do. Dont even think about telling HR or your head that your job is affecting your mental health, you will also get fired within days, when they make up an excuse as to why. ASOS make out they care about mental health awareness, they are liars.   You are overworked here, and stressed out, it can take 2+ years to progress to a more senior position as everyone is very clicky. People above you will give you work way above your level because theyre too lazy to do it themselves but say it is for your progression. A lot of employees in buying do not last, as no one genuinely cares about you. Take my advice and DO NOT WORK HERE.. Management is lacking and lack of respect for the employees. Customers can only contact via online. Each time customers get in touch it will be with a new adviser even if the case is ongoing.. High degree of favoritism within a team, excessive office politics between teams, and HR has zero confidentiality  Employees are often on PIP with little time to demonstrate improvement before they are terminated. Promised progression and promotion that never happened Poor communication  Struggles to make simple decisions  Poor salary  Benefits being cut School like environment  Terrible hours with very early starts and late finishes including weekends and bank holidays. a lot of tasks need to be done. Shifts are different each week, targets to hit or you are out, watch your every move. No room to progress. A lot of redundancy issues.. Pay rate, growth in career. Shifts were different every week. Not given enough support and are technical. Progression slower than some companies I have worked for previously as you get higher up in level.. bad pay, badly organised/ managed and they timed toilet breaks. Awful management No communication Treat employees awfully Hardly any progression No work/life balance due to shift patter s. Made employees redundant as a group via casual conversation!. Difficult to progress and get promoted due to limited head count. Hard to progress, mixed salaries for same role. Due to rapid growth the office was under constant change.. Can be difficult to progress.. Terrible management, lack of training for new starters, no concern for health or mental health. Terrble handling of Covid. Extremely negative place to work in, feels like highschool. The company has grown rapidly over the last 10 years and some key systems have struggled to grow in tandem. These include development, recognition and overall engagement from staff. There is also a huge disconnect between senior management and staff, especially within CC.. Overworked, extremely competitive promotions, when put forward for promtions over 100 people go for an interview process with only one position available which is extremely hard to prep for as well as doing your day job. To get signed off you need to tick off certain tasks whihc are hard to when there is not enough staff and the role is so admin heavy. Busy environment, centre of London so expensive to travel. Upper management wasnt that great and didnt listen to employees. shifts were long and weirdly spaced ,one minute on earlies then lates. Underpaid and overworked staff in my position. Challenges with some senior management, and a bit of a blame culture, which makes it difficult for individuals to thrive. Culture of long working hours, little support for flexible working within retail. -Management treat you like a slave -Team managers are entitled to talk bad to you and treat you bad -They follow you when you go to the bathroom -Management time you when you go to the bathroom -Barista talk bad to everybody. Redundancies constantly, so not a reliable role Lack of communication. No sales bonus for staffs. Financial issues, risks of redundancy.. Their employees are the least important thing to them. In the past year myself and my colleagues have been through Several round of redundancy and not once offered any kind of support or an understanding ear from upper management. The ASOSers make this company who they are and to see them treated so poorly pushed me to leave. In my own person experience, I witnessed team leaders and advisors pushed to their breaking points with no support what so ever from those direct reports. Managers dont get to know the advisors in their operations or how they are working.. Some politics across the company between departments. - Management were awful. My manager was rude, aggressive, had no idea how to manage, would actively single people out, made my life miserable the whole time I was there, mentally attacked people and their personalities - just awful. She was a BULLY, no other word for it.  - HR did nothing for their employees despite numerous complaints about these bullies - The role was completely not what it was supposed to be, I spent most of the time reconciling invoices because the company is massively in debt to their brands - Brands were cutting them off because they owed them millions of pounds, quite surprised how they stay afloat!  - Very cliquey, and not very culturally diverse. You either have to be white or act white to fit in here. - Have clothes sales for staff but most sizes were below size 6 for females, makes sense and most of the girls there do look anorexic - General bad vibe, no one I met was actually happy there but stayed because of the company. No future No opportunity  Made us redundant to employ people in Philippines. Not so much a con but this is a fast-paced company so priorities can change quickly.. nights some workers seem to know how to cheat the system. Like a robot Xpo staff are superior. Inexperienced leadership and awful shift rotation. My manager wasn't a people person. Not good management, benefits were all taken away and pay was decreased. Stretched very thin, expected to step into full time roles with minimal training.. The lack of genuine progression due to being a high performer, a culture of favouritism and praise based on friendships- if you are here to be recognised for hard work and being a good person then you have come to the wrong place - this claims to value this but it couldnt be further from the truth. No cons that I can think of except for the size of the company and industry restructures are common. Robotic, constantly being watched. Everything is tracked. Very repetitive work, management sat around doing nothing getting paid over twice your salary which isn't particularly motivating. You need to be liked for the person you are to get promotion, easy for some but frustrating for others. Clone Culture, no diversity.  Toxic HR. School like environment, not much support from management. Organisational structure is confused but is likely to change. Overloaded with work and there is a lack of professionalism at times with no clear company guidelines. poor senior management and the CEO has shown his diversity, equality and inclusion is all a smoke and mirrors act. He has repeatedly shown he doesn't care about his staff unless they're high up or stakeholders. Office is like a school playground and if you're not willing to brown nose or fall in line, you will be managed out. Red tape, complex org structure and too many middle managers. Management in cliques prevent progression.. It's a young company which you grow out of and move on.. People keeps progressing just by being there instead of recruiting actual professional for certain roles. Admin Heavy, takes long time to progress. It's a safe place to work but not very much appreciated. they fib a bit about the future. Low salaries, over worked and very busy. Hard to progress, long hours. Bad terms, bad managerial attitude. Can seem lonely, as you work independently. Stressful and very hectic at times. slow progression, feels like you are not valued. The assistants earn 18-22k and this is not enough to live in London, especially when you have to get in for 6.45-7am on Mondays and rarely get out of work before 7pm. There is a culture of over-working and if you try to go home on time there can be comments (I should mention there is a clever clause in your contract that states that you might have to work overtime for free!). Also its very high stress for the pay you get and as much as some people are lovely, some are awful and on more than one occasion I've heard people crying in the toilets.. Salary, diversity, progression, work life balance. Little room for progression, redundancy, higher up decisions made for the business and not staff. Shift based job no work-life balance  Redundancy process not ethical.  Many cost cuts that effect employees. Unrealistic understandings in TA function and the differences between tech hiring and finance, vs fashion. Not a one size fits all. really bad experience with management, someone under qualified was promoted to a team leader role and this subsequently forced most of the team members to hand in their notice due to the poor leadership and lack of care for other employees. the person in question who was promoted was the only male person within a team of about 8 and also was close friends from school with one the head of post production, who then interviewed him for the team leader role. they didn't seem to care when everyone started handing in their notice and felt deflated and demotivated to work since one of the worst members of the team was promoted .. Management have their favourite choices of photographers Freelance job days are not first come first serve but whoever they see fit  Poor communication  Will drop you without any explanation. why do I have to do this. management felt distant and cliquey i don't want to be part of the fast fashion business model that based on news and research is causing a lot of issues for the poor around the world and our planet. Too many manual processes, low salary for the amount of work, work role status is in limbo after CC redundancies. Too much bureaucracy involved meant slow paced work. perks were good at first but were stripped back, unequal pay, poor manager (as direct reports, we had more experience and knowledge than the person we reported into). Fast paced and big company, hard to stand out. Outsourcing to other countries CC is not based in UK anymore. A lot of empty promises in the end as a lot of us were made redundant (not due to COVID). Hard to progress, very limited opportunities. Slow progression within the roles. Unprofessional Company culture  Company values training programs community involvement. customers can be abuse sometimes. Customer Care now minimal and outsourced. micro management, very little opportunity for progression.. No cons, great company to join. There was a bully mentality, progression was not an option in the HR department unless you conformed. Opinions or hard work was not valued or recognised. In turn led to a lack of support or care for HR employees mental health mainly caused by a toxic work environment.. No progression, poor management, redundancy. Bus times are not great from Barnsley asos. Fast pace and always lots to do!. Continuous redundancy in the company, workload is high, slow progression and bad pay rise. Reduce workload and hire more people!. Lack of care for employees. Rubbish management You're treated like a child Never an available manager when you need one Managers don't seem to understand the job of standard advisors. Lack of work life balance and flexibility. So many levels promotions are slow. Fast paced with heavy workload. Some benefits being taken away. Micro management, no progression, redundancies. Senior management not very professional and ceo all about himself. micro management, redundancies, no room for progression. - Micro managing QA leads - Projects didn't have direction and were running over budget - Business didn't have much confidence in the tech team. GLC is still running, and it's clepotocracy, management make their own promo codes and senior management rob the company. Old CCM signed a nda after paying his own private company hundreds of thousands. The company is messed up to it's core The watford office smelt of drugs and GLC you find powder in the toliets. This is all acutally true. You could make a movie from ASOS. DO NO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. Salary isnt the greatest for the level of work done. Low hourly rate, unsociable hours. Quick to ideation, slower to deliver. Has become corporate as it has grown up over the last decade. Democracy is a plus and drawback as there can be a lot of meetings and little achieved.   If this were a smaller company I don't think it could sustain the meetings and design by committee approach. This has gotten worse in the last decade.  Recent restructure is, in the short term at least, very inefficient and came just before the most demanding part of the financial year (Black Friday Weekend). Bottle neck for progression Becoming more corporate losing core values. Poor progression Low salary progression Extremely competitive. Big walks you know man. extreme levels of workload with little relief. A lot of constant change. Feels like very slow progression. Salary does not show that they put the workers first.. Accept any roles in London headquarters only. nothing wrong, I can't think of anything. Can be long hours but this is expected. Over worked and under paid.. Pay is not a lot for my self personally.. Progression is not quick at this business. There is no possibility to grow internally. You wont understand a thing thats management is doing. Low pay and slow career progression. Below industry standard for pay. The only other issue I have is how management speak to the rest of asos. See below.. Haven't experienced any in my time there. Lacks structure due to fast-paced nature. Fast paced well established environment. Long hours poor time management and slow progression. Much more needed around flexibility - so behind the times. The Customer Care Graduate Scheme did not guarantee a job upon completion. The majority of grads ended up leaving as a result. - benefits slowly diminishing - no bonus in all my years there  - discount reduced - lack of progression/ development  - lack of movement within company. There is ZERO accountability for line managers Not encouraged to move sideways into different departments Transformation programs very messy. No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,. hectic and poor communication with little career development. Increasingly corporate Lack of diversity throughout and within board Made to come into the office throughout COVID So much work and not much appreciation. Culture, poor management, underlying internal politics, poor recruitment, poor policies. A lot of benefits have gone. Our team has lost two thirds of the people but there's the same amount of work or more. No time to focus on personal growth or anything else because there's so much work. Design leadership also gone so there's no direction or inspiration any more.. Expensive to get to each day. You need to be the management favourite. Poor management Salaries Low opportunities Strict processes Too far away from the train station. Autocratic, very bad culture/behaviours, misogynistic boys club, wild. Management / top level / pay. very cliquey, lots of micro-managing. Secondary school environment, slow progression you have tiers in the job roles eg MA has 3 levels to pass to become an AM could take up to 6 years to progress to the level above. Pay is shocking youll get better pay in a supermarket, no disrespect. It isnt what you think it will be I wish I listened to the reviews before I started. Expected to work long hours without recognition. Treated like a child. - very poor work life balance, WFH not a thing - progression is tough and there's a very much a favouritism culture - lots of unnecessary admin. None, that I would like to comment. Not enough hours a week. discount cut redundancies no more staff appreciation days no job security. very strict timings on breaks- micromanaged. - No work life balance - All benefits have slowly been reduced.. Slow progression Slow integration of new systems. Not as many opportunities for personal development. Where do I begin. Everything was wrong from the start. They were not geared up to welcome new starters and I waited 8 weeks for the systems access in order to do my job properly. I then waited a further 4 weeks for my line manager to hand over jobs to me because they are the worst micro managers and dont know how to delegate or manage their time. On top of that the blame culture within ASOS is the worst I have ever experienced, no one is accountable for anything with a lot of people looking to hide mistakes, blame someone else and talk down to you. I have spent the last 5 months being gaslighted by my boss who is incompetent and thrives off making people feel bad about themselves. The systems at ASOS are not fit for purpose and you spend 80% of your time waiting for reports to run/information to come back and even then you have to run 3 reports because the reporting system cant handle the amount of lines youre reporting on. The whole set up is a waste of peoples time and skills. I am fortunate enough to have never suffered from my mental health prior to working here but the way I have been treated at ASOS means I have suffered from the worst anxiety and panic attacks ever. There hasnt been a day I havent cried or been treated poorly and the job isnt worth it, the workload and the pay is the worst. Dont put yourself through it. They email on sundays and at 9pm + and it is not conducive to good work life balance or a happy lifeX. Sometimes can feel a little hectic, so not everyones cup of tea. However if you can handle it, youll thrive at ASOS.. toxic culture, boys club, lack of progression. the only cons no many Career Opportunities. Low salary in comparison to competitors. Have to think about it. Progression based on who you know rather than skills or experience All employees are disposable. Office politics and high turnover. There are no cons from working at asos. progression was slow and managers made it clear the level difference. Long and expensive commute from London. Big company so can get lost amongst other employees. Long hours, weekends, not enough event parties,. Weekends work management not great either. No bank holiday extras. Gone into administration. (Glassdoor would not let me select this option). the working environment could be more diverse. Very patriarchal and unrepresentative at the top.. I never openly talked about my religion but I am muslim with a black girlfriend. The culture in the ML team around ethnic minorities and muslims is disgusting. A very undiverse almost like an Oxford version of Google rejects.  Long hours with weekend working  no progression unless you know how to stroke egos  The team don't understand experimental research methods or machine learning outside of neural networks  extreme bias against working class, BAME, and muslims.  Product owners don't know much about product ownership or management. Expect you to do a job three times your salary and wont progress you. Progression is dependant entirely on your personal relationship with your team leader regardless of your personal qualities.. Dont reflect that in salary. night shift were quite long. Hours too long and different. VERY SLOW progression and not enough time to do all tasks. Always too cold, shifts, management. lack of career progression, management go on holiday when you're a new starter leaving you to manage a department on your own, you work long hours with no appreciation. long hours, and difficult technology. very little/ barely any room for growth  admin heavy   no pay for overtime. lack of support &amp; work over time. no cons loved ever minute of it. No cons for me was a very good experience. Some organisational complexity in achieving clear outcomes. Accountability was often unclear. Technology &amp; Product often worked against, instead of with each other. Unclear team &amp; departmental level objectives.. Can't think of any cons. - toxic environment dominated by politics in the management layer - big egoes in the management layer - HR taking the side of the more powerful rather than acting as an impartial  - completely lack of transparency - company values are true only on paper. No or slow progression, low salary compared to some other companies. Lost it's niche! Getting too corporate.. None that you don't get in any job. Can get a bit hectic as there are so many people in one building. over worked, underpaid, very very slow progression lack of care in a pandemic stressful environment, blame culture, low morale in teams. Fast growing company that cant keep up with growth spurt. just a number, clicky, dead end job. Can be repetitive Atmosphere usually stressed. Not a huge room for progression unless people leave. Management deem you as difficult if you question there decisions. High volume and high pressured environment. Leadership could be a bit more transparent. Long hours, work life balance, blame culture. Micromanaging all over the place. Long hours, slow progression, work weekends  management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising. Management is very poor, doing everything by the book. You are always being watched, being told off even if you spend one minute extra on your toilet break. No room for promotion.. Bias agency  Hard work especially stock control Be aware of the women with ginger hair in pod 3 : NIGHTMARE. Salary ratio to Hours worked. lots of extra unpaid hours worked, hierarchy and treatment off management. I didn't get paid for my overtimes. Progression - there are 3 stages per role. 0 transparency toward the staff. Bad management  Un appreciative of staff. High likelihood of last minute team and department changes. Lack of females within the senior leadership teams.. Decision making is often questionable and you can feel frustrated.. too much work, too much fatigue, target very heavy to achieve. Communications need some improvement, lack of diversity in exec board &amp; leadership. the workload is very heavy - expect to work a lot more than contracted hours. only black guy in the team. Not enough comms from management, cliquey, not enough diversity.. - VERY hard to be promoted, needs to be the right timing, things change a lot. - depending on you're line manger, some people shouldn't be mangers.. Very fast paced and sometimes direction can change quickly. Treated like youre at school. - lack of communication - no clear company policy/entitlement rights. Salaries have slipped way below market. 1. No more good parties. Very top down communication. No incentive or encouragement to pursue passion projects/change. Little emphasis on sustainability. Pay is okay but no room for negotiation.. lack of progression low Pay. Low salary for London life. Its a typical big corporation in many ways- high turnover of staff and the training you receive upon starting is terrible.. Can be a tough Environment to work in with high expectations and long hours. Department lacked vision and leadership was lackluster. Outsourcing to poor external company caused more problems than it solved. Benefits increasingly reduced. Hamstrung by poor policies e.g. we would be punished if we attempted to refund a delivery charge (for a late delivery or in the case that an order wasn't delivered) unless the customer actively asked us to.. management , wage , hours , facilities. Progression within department is next to impossible. long work hours, normal pay. * Management are often quite late in sharing organisational changes * For the work that LSEs do, they deserve a little more compensation. Some Company benefits depend on department. Pair programming disaster, chaos environment, noise in the office, low salaries, no bonus, siloses of knowledge, architects living in their own world. Low salary compared to other businesses. Clear favouritism within the organisation and salary did not quite match with the workload. Working on womenswear - not such a good vibe Some people have big egos Teams work differently within a department. Very little progression, base salary is very low. Kids managing kids, poor leadership, more invested in making the work place look nice than how they treated staff. My impression of this company is that it is full of jerks. They're above average in the narcissism department, but I don't think that explains it entirely. I read in another review about islamophobia. I was also shocked by attitudes towards muslims during my very brief time at ASOS. Attitudes from some quite well paid people. I complained about it to HR. They told me I was lying. When I proved I wasn't they said they didn't care. It felt at times like working for an organised crime ring. I've worked for a lot of companies. I found this place horrid. And depressing. I don't think I've ever found going into work so depressing in my life.. Nepotism C suite arrogance Lack of innovation. Where do I even begin with this? We were overworked and underpaid, expected to work long hours (particularly on Monday when the systems would crash as you tried to do anything). If you left on time youd be on the receiving end of tuts and snarky comments.  There was absolutely no chance for progression. I made it clear during my interview that was what I was looking for in this job and was promised the world but what I found instead was tasks being dropped on you from a higher level under the guise of progression, only to receive no assistance and when you (inevitably) fail youd be blasted in front of the whole team. Youd also be expected to cover colleagues work when on holiday which on its own is not a unfair request but on multiple occasions I had to pick up a colleagues task they had left for days only to be told off and when I couldnt cover my workload, their workload, helping to train a new person and the task theyd just left prior to their holiday - somehow myself not being able to cover this was my issue and not the issue of the person on holiday.  This brings us to the biggest issue I found at ASOS the workplace bullying. I loathe to call someone this but my manager was nothing more than a bully protected by the managers above them. Once they had decided they had it out for me my time was done and I was bullied to the point of a mental breakdown, and pulled into a meeting where I felt I had no choice to quit or be fired. In a last ditch attempt I went to HR only to have them feed back to my bullys manager who in turn pulled me to one side and brought up the comments I had made. So much for confidentially. In the end I felt like I had to rescind my comments in my exit interview for fear of my reference being in danger.   Never been so happy to leave a job in my life.. nothing bad to say about it really. On your feet all shift. Poor management who are completely detached from the processes involved in entry level roles, lack of support for new employees, difficult to progress (very rigid promotion structure where you have to be in specific roles for a certain amount of time before being 'allowed' to be put forward for promotions), don't often have enough time in the day to make use of any of the perks, lots of staff are extremely unhappy and the retention rate within teams is low.. management , building , lowering the discount , making people redundant. People with a bit of power are arrogant, from other deparments as well, there are no team work at all and no chances to progress if you're a foreigner.. no personal life, extremely stressful, limited work life balance. Senior leadership rolling back benefits, terrible pay (despite increased profits) &amp; many senior team managers have no people leadership skills. Favouriting managers, poor level of management. Progression  salary increases Diversity needs to improve. Toxic, No room for progression, treated as a number, not respected, undervalued, overworked, cliche fashion environment</td>\n",

much with progression, no incentive to work harder, high turnover of staff, poor systems. Very low salary, poor working conditions, very little training provided but high expectations. Micro management are young, inexperienced and superficial girls who are not able to provide guidance and support for their teams.. Abysmal pay, around minimum wage. No actual training for your job role. No incentive to improve. training. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth when the CEO drives a roll royce and the majority of the workers are payed so lowly. The management and seniors are ruthless. No training for staff. Staff are poorly paid and virtually no retention. The consultants have no communication and despite being a \"national\" firm they can't seem to understand anything beyond Bromsgrove.. Not treated at all well after 6 yrs of being a loyal hard working member of staff . This company just pushes you out and replaces you with someone who they think is right or someone who just agrees !  It's called constructive dismissal , note to self should of took this to court !   Not sure who owns the company as the CEO seems to let the operations manager run the place ! Which nobody has respects for !   HR do not trust at all they there to help employees but all they do is protect the company !   To much work , stressful , salary low , lack of experienced staff in admin !   I would not recommend AFH to anyone Employee of choice they call it funny it's definitely not !. I am unable to find any Cons for AFH Wealth Management.  This is a great company to work for.. I cannot think of any cons for working for AFH.. Abysmal pay. Try to get away with paying staff bare minimum. Really high staff turnover.. Sometimes you have to wash up your own cup !!. Lack of support to develop. The HR team is a shambles.. i worked at their AFH Insure division, give you leads that are impossible to work.  Training pretty much none existent. Desk managers cant help as they are expected to generate their own sales and struggle to help their team to improve the overall desk revenue.  Cold calling the same people over and over again even when told not to ring back.  I spent last week ring people over 70 if they want life insurance,  or reviewing old policies.  Cancel your current policy and then take out one with less cover for more money.. Progression is hard, almost feels like the supervisors/managers dont want progression sometimes.   Pay is too low. No cons to speak of. Nothing worth mentioning at all.. None I can think of.. Too many to list unfortunately. IMO and based on my experiences there: Unless this is your first job where you get some workplace experience, don't apply.  Extremely unethical practices Senior Leadership Team are mostly internally promoted therefore leave very little to be desired in terms of how to actually run a business. Toxic culture SLT like to talk about innovation or change but have no idea how to implement or probably even want to HR team are also incompetent and I personally was privy to numerous unethical practices when recruiting.. Salary for administration staff needs to be looked into. (Extra 2-4k a year to match other companies will improve statistics). Autocratic, very much a my way or the highway organisation. Quality control an issue, with an emphasis on volume rather than quality. Largely ineffective middle management. Training and upskilling are low priorities. Some job insecurity, the company can be quite ruthless when managing out people.. Supervisor made me very uneasy from the start never introduced me to the rest of the team, not a people person and wasnt approachable. was not supportive and expects you to know exactly what youre doing even if you have never been in that sector before.. Poor pay, huge gap for pay between senior management vs those who support them, managers who bully yet you are the one driven away, lack of flexibility. Salaries are much lower than market competitors and there is no standard salary ladder, they just pay each individual person whatever they can get away with. Most of management is shocking and know nothing about how the company/processes work - or how to manage a team, young girls just go for the promotion for the higher pay but are not capable of doing any management role There is no progression at all. Management can be clicky at times. -Low Salary -Middle Management likes to micro Manage  -Staff Retention in Investment Admin team very low. Views itself as a boutique, not able to break out of a mould. IT accessories are old and cheap - monitors, mouse, etc.. Awful management  Micro management Only care about numbers and money not the happiness of their staff Happy to go against government guidelines and risk the health and safety of staff members to prematurely make staff go into the office even though people were t pleased with it- when I told them I was unhappy with the 6 days notice they terminated my contract with immediate effect for this reason  They dont care about their staff at all and if you raise an concerns or voice your own opinion they will get rid of you with no valid reason and will not follow any procedure.. -Unachievable bonus unfairly set by manager -bullying -MICROMANAGEMENT  -long hours  -no sympathy to people who travel or have children  -Manager is extremely rude and condescending -High staff turnover  -Mistreatment of staff -False promises -Lied to about job role-it was cold calling  -If you challenge management you are fired without warning or proper procedures -Do not follow covid guidelines -Poor response from hr and manager as a whole  -Insufficient workload but then have the cheek to ask you what you're doing. Borderline bullying, nepotism, overworked - steer clear. Communication between departments is lacking   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Regular issues with the various computer systems, sometimes creates a perfect storm in which next to no work can be achieved. Almost non-existant progression ladder. Experience and hard work generally remains unacknowledged by management. Equally, industry qualifications seem to count for nothing. Low pay compared to similar positions in other companies. Lack of communication between management and the staff.. As managers have been there for 10 years or more, the opportunities to move up are few and far between. Like a lot of companies, directors have their favourites who will move up regardless of experience or talent.. Salary was very basic. I felt that for the pressure and amount of work, the salary elsewhere is much higher and a lot more competitive.. Will only progress if you know the right people. HR department are not worthy of being the \"go to\" for staff members as they are not trusted and underhand/biased promotions. No flexibility with hours. Hire too many \"kids\" so they can pay cheap wages - and therefore no-one gets treated like an adult or trusted. If you're not liked by the right people you're bullied out.. Not very strong work ethics especially on the team I worked, People should take a more positive approach to work and not just \"do the job\". Hard performers are neither recognised nor rewarded, not very good basic pay and enormous amount of workload within an understaffed team that's main focus should be clients.. Underpaid therefore experienced staff leave making the role harder to do. The company  should increase wages and give people incentives to stay.. Managers just give mates a job, absolutely no prospects and they will regret letting all the experienced staff leave because they are doing. Management are detached  Monotonous Ambition is frowned upon Progression impossible. Poor salary. Support to progress is non existent. There is a huge 'Face fits' culture. Poor operating systems. Training is lacking.. Parking can be an issue and there could be more social engagements available.. Very poor management and lack basic understanding of diversity.. Communication in certain situations & could have higher pension contribution from the company.. Parking is an issue around Tunbridge Wells but there is ample non-resident street parking around the town and some on-site parking available to staff and easy access to rail links.. - Current building is slightly dated however we are moving to a brand new location early this year which has great new facilities including a gym and social areas.. Current office slightly dated, but with a move to a new office space in a few months, nothing to worry about.. Parking is an issue, and the building is outdated however the move to EQ4 early this year will go some way to addressing these.. Current building is very shabby, but we're moving soon. Sometimes it feels like your asked for an opinion on something even though the decision is already made. Can take a while to replace people, suspect down to recruitment policies (see 'pros' list). Pension offering not great in current market. Parking is limited but with the new site move this should hopefully be resolved.. Nature of business doesn't allow true flexible working. Benefits (e.g. pension) package not as competitive as it could be for sector. Very busy, not making full use of all facilities, but this will change as the team develops. They don't give people a fair chance, the basic HR system of aptitude tests doesn't work when it comes to employing new people or promoting those at junior levels. systems need a lot of work. None - only reason I left was they closed the Tunbridge Wells office. Very different cultures between Manchester & London offices, which are not always to the benefit of the company.  The company is so driven to remain at the bleeding edge of the industry, that it ignores what it already has.  Embarrassingly poor benefits package.  Customer service could be better - you get what you pay for.. Lower than average pension contribution.  Low holiday allowance (but increases with service and buy holiday scheme).. Terrible upper management who dump things on you Promotions are very biased within the company, interviews are more for show when going for a promotion as the decision is likely to have already been made. Boring work, low pay, hard to progress, poor culture, role was not as advertised. Large turnover of staff lower paid roles. Low pay & small bonuses Repetitive work Every promotion is highly competitive Some teams are managed worse than others Customer service clients are not nice to deal with Only 22 days holidays. Poor company pension - for a pension company! Astonishing staff turnover.   Few opportunities to move up the ladder, no matter what skills you have. Would rather cut corners than fix source of problems or deal with systemic issues.. Salary, although advertised as competitive, often falls short of the mark when compared to market competitors which can create a level of dissatisfaction within the workforce. Pay progression is also slow with little clarity on how to move up the pay scale. This is not helped by emails often sent by the board advertising how profitable the company is continuing to be. Despite being a relatively young company some of the views and attitudes held higher in the company can sometimes be a little Dickensian with regards to feedback and criticism.. - Soul-less working environment - Inconvenient place to work (no parking facilities and difficult to get to) - Opportunities for social or charity work only goes to management or C-level - Out-dated Working From Home policy - No trust of staff from Management and above - Promotions given based on longevity, rather than skill / experience - What they say and what they do are different  In my view, I have seen all of these things, although some apply to how other members of staff were treated, not me.. Pay falls very short of the market rate, progression is encouraged and easy if you work hard however wages barely increase.. Due to location parking can be difficult for those without a company space, although public transport links nearby are very good.. None at all from my perspective. I have no real cons about the place. What I have found is that where an issue is raised the business listen and try to react. Also, the business proactively look for concerns with an annual survey as well as ongoing communication.. Pension Contribution % is a bit low. pension contribution could be a little higher but all the benefits offered outweigh this.. Company benefits slightly worse than other places I have worked. The salary could be better when comparing it to other similar job roles. - low pension contribution - slightly lower pay than other companies. Whilst the location of the office is in an up and coming area of Manchester that is being heavily developed it can be difficult for some to access via public transport, in particular by train. A large portion of staff do however get access to free onsite parking.. None , , , ,. Low pay Low pension contributions. Car parking a joke, as its a lottery system. Culture is a big thing with The company, but in reality, it has a culture of sexism (unless you sleep with one of the managers) , bullying, finger pointing, cover ups and drinking. Might be worth the staff being breathalysed on payday Friday drinks, as staff are encouraged to drink to excess and drive home. Systems are a joke, constant IT failures, penalised by management on your bonus for not hitting your target. Management use sick pay as a weapon as to whether your face fits. HR are a joke, they dont care about your mental health, but boast on social media that they have mental health coffee morning chats available for staff, this is far from the truth as this never happens. They claim that they support the LGBTQ+ community, but in truth, the pride parade is no more than a publicity and promotional event. The toilets are unhygienic and stink. Unhygienic kitchen. So glad Im working from home at the moment. Senior management walk about the department in a bid to appear visible but they dont acknowledge you or talk to you. Its more like a power trip. None that I can think of. there are no cons currently. Salary is on the lower end of the spectrum.. Salary wise not much productive. Nothing much is negative to say. -Pension contributions -Cant think of anything else!. Pathological command and control culture. Managers completely detached from reality.  Aggressive senior member of staff using obscene language at daily stand up to describe other staff members and teams.  Manager behaving in misogynistic fashion making inappropriate comments to female members of staff and ignoring toxic behaviour within the team.  Passive aggressive HR department \"We use a Bradford scoring system, so don't ever get sick\". Bombarding everyone with pointless, endless mandatory training courses.  Ancient tech stack, rotten code base, irrational resistance to refactoring, changing or upgrading existing code.. Doesn't pay enough money etc. The training isnt always provided. started to become like a call centre. Its like a school playground. Very cliquey, unbelievably toxic environment, with harmful rumours spread and spiteful comments made if youre not part of the in crowd.. First the minor points: - Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business. - Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business - The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short. - Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.  The major failings: - HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go. - Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so theres almost a fear of being ill. - Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports. - Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But theyre seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture. - Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved.. Awful cronyism in middle to higher management. If you look the part and suck up to the right people then you can go far.. Pension contributions from employer are embarrassing. No pay rises during a year of record profits.. Poor salary, no freedom to express yourself. Wage i think is too low. Feel like one of many Underpaid to a degree. Pension contribution should be higher Bonus not the biggest Salary on the lower side for some roles Parking used to be a problem but not during lockdown. Under staffed, poorly managed, undelivered promises. You can call this AJ Hell. Pension contribution is lower than my previous employer, but the holidays and job security outweigh that.. No consideration to the staff, customer and sla is more important than any illness or mental health issue that you have, low pay for high stress job, compulsory overtime when busy, difficult to progress. Salary The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.  Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.  Management  Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed.   Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isnt which is lying to upper management.   Culture  Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams arent run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.  Promotions  Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit.   IT systems  The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close calls so it appears as though your issues are resolved.  Overall:  Good place to start your career or use as a stepping stone to advance your career.. Pay is not enough, too much work. Job stability, unpaid overtime and low bonus.. For me, not much. I would like to be paid more (who wouldnt)  but theres still good training and study opportunities.    Theres not much to the social side at the moment for obvious reasons but its good to see online events happening like cocktail making.  Theres also access to online exercise classes and PTs while the gym isnt open.. Where do we start?  After being offered the job you realise quickly youve been given a position in the  overworked scapegoat department.   Pay variance- its massive between us some admins. Although its top secret, you are not suppose to discuss what you get paid. If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if youre promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage.   You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued.   Never go against the gain- youll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime.   Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot!   Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they dont care!   Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.  MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.    Overtime- you wont get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here!   Dont appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. Im sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope.   Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like thats what your aspirations in life are!   Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.  IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk!   Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santas (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.  Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion.   HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. Its basically do as I say not as I do.. Overworked, underpaid.   Bad management.   Staff burnout because understaffing, compulsory overtime and too much business.   Cant get staff quick enough for how many people leave so pull people over from other teams.   No concern for mental health or wellbeing unless they can write a blog about it to share on the intranet or publicly.   BARELY following Government Guidelines for COVID in comparison to other corporate companies.   HR act like they are on your side but are just there to find loopholes to make your issue your problems and not AJ Bells  Managers and TLs do not listen to their staff when offered suggestions to lighten the work load.. Senior management, planning, systems, HR, pay gaps, bullying. As such a large company, it can be hard to get to know people outside of your team. Low pay for the work that is carried out Overworked staff Limited growth opportunities Management don't seem to listen to the needs of their employees. Pay could be better and the pension contribution is a little low. Some systems and processes are still developing to back up the rapid growth. Progression can be challenging within the admin departments. Salaries below external market rates Employee benefits need improvement e.g. employer pension contributions Limited opportunities for experienced people Micro management work culture No flexi-time working available Statutory minimum annual leave. Benefits package is below standard. Progression. Yes you can progress if your face fits and you don't disagree with a decision from the top. They have a habit of promoting some shockingly bad people to managers just because their face fits, never mind if they can actually do the role. It's not the case in all departments but just the majority especially customer services.  People have been told outright not to apply for promotions as they want external candidates but then hire someone internal the week after.   A fair go. The company currently utilises the government levy for apprenticeships and this includes team leader and management courses. To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.    lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug.   bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses arent assessed fairly and they vary department by department.   poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking.   Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied.   All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places.. - Piss-poor salaries. Clearly taking advantage of young workers who don't know better. No payrises across the board in a year with record profits, record client growth and record shareholder dividends. - Management is stubborn does not welcome creativity or new ideas - everyth - Insufficient resources to get jobs done within service level agreements. Approving budgets to increase headcount takes place at a glacial place by which point teams are already way behind. Place seems to be run by stingy bean counters who don't recognise that explosive client growth is going to require similar increases in headcount. - Management does not listen to valid concerns of employees and prefers to shut down viewpoints of employees who go off-script - Few opportunities for meaningful progression unless you are willing to brown-nose your way to the top - Long hours (8.45 - 5.15, why can't it just be a 9-5?). There used to be limited parking spaces for staff but this has changed with the move to more home working. Poor pay, poor pension matching considering pensions are a large part of the business, many departments are understaffed and there is pressure on individuals to cover the shortfall rather than giving teams the extra manpower they need.. Awful company to work for. Pay and opportunities are rubbish. - AJ Bell like to hire youngsters fresh out of uni or from their first job at a shoe shop with no financial experience. This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with. - AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated. - It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them & make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave. - The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away. - Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management).   \n",
       "2  For a company where it's shop window and everything behind it relies totally on IT, the directors seem to know soo little about IT and as a result have gone through a chain of hiring sociopath to sociopath to be in charge of large parts of or all of IT over the years. They want a new, interesting company like ASOS to be linked to their career and use big names of other (often much more stuffy) business to get in through the door, then pull the IT department back into the 20th century.   The worst one was a recent CIO hire who started with a statement of intent of who they are and what they want to and don't want to do. Very quickly each of these promises was broken. Even worse, heads under them were replaced by people they had worked with in every company from the past 6-10 years of their career. These people were not brought in on merit. The result was a very strong cult of personality driving people out of the company, a swelling contract budget (more mates brought in) and importantly very little credible, long term value to the business. Having worked at the company for a long time it made me sick to see such a sought after and popular company get taken in by these people.  Not unusual I know but HR really are the pits, smiling assassins but dressed up to the nines.. - Management - they had no idea what they were doing - it was a real mess and they didn't listen - Career development - the performance review process is really bad and not based on merit. Also, you can expect to be boxed into a job and not being allowed to get involved in anything else at all - Technology - messy, old, things barely work and frequently break. Tense atmosphere, newcomers are more or less ignored and not showed around properly. Far too much work to get through in one day, with low freelance rates - you're expected to work like a machine, and made to feel inadequate if there is a mistake. People seem uninterested, fake and cliquey.. Unfriendly colleagues - cliquey atmosphere Disorganised chaos of clothing in the buying department - barely enough space to get desk Managers are too wrapped up in themselves with no real idea of what is going on in their team. begins to be more corporate and more difficult to interact. bureaucracy, hierarchy, low salary, NO DIRECTION, politics, inefficiency, hr department disastrous. Some of the internal systems are frustrating to use, often required to work long hours but rewarded for hard work in other ways and always appreciated!. No BYOD policy.   Still some cumbersome systems and processes in place but getting better all the time.   It's in a listed building so the plumbing can be a bit flaky and getting a lift to the 6th floor can be a long business.. So much is going on it's a struggle for team and programmes to keep track and on top of things. Changing direction quickly and context switching is hard. IT is seen as a burden on the business.. Rapid change is great but it's hard for the resources and systems to keep ahead of what's needed. Cattiness, lots of clueless middle management. if no work got sent home or not to come in and did not get paid for this if you had any holidays you had to use them to make your pay up. As any business growing very fast there are some challenges to deal with such as not very helpful processes or some legacy technologies to improve. you may have to walk 10 miles in a shift, power hungry lower management, very high temperatures in summer 30 degrees+ , no allowed to settle in one environment constantly moved around to where workers required either receiving,put away,returns,hygiene,pick, pack, dispatch etc each with its own kpi that you have to achieve or face a disciplinary even if you have an accident you face a full investigation, alcohol and drug tests then another disciplinary, if you have time off due to genuine sickness they do not believe you and you face the occupational safety nurse to find out what you can do! If you suffer from asthma or any other lung/respiratory complaint don't bother as the dust and heat will put you in hospital.Poor Health and Safety every week there is a new regulation that you have to adhere to now we have to ware glove's for all \"dangerous\" conditions.The local doctors have two common ailments the ASOS cough (caused by the dust0 and the ASOS bad back (caused by the heavy work). Not that I can't do it I'm an ex miner but it is punishing running up and down five flights of stairs constantly!!. People have the \"I don't really care \" attitude to work No training whatsoever Outdated tools Cold office Salaries rises are given based on favouritism. One may get thousands the other pity pennies.(fact) Middle management has no management skills No room for progression Full of people bored who can't really bother hence nothing ever gets done Rules are not same for all Performance at work is an utter joke. One may get an above and beyond by doing little, though that doesn't translate into more money so why should one bother?. No real career progression and you sense the company prefers employees with no ambition so they don't complain about the poor pay and lack of opportunities. Staff are treated much like children.. Too many layers of middle management that don't fully understand what the team they are managing actually does.. Although they have some good ideas for their website and offer hundreds of products, undercover IT is a mess and at risk of falling apart. The culture is very immature and you are more likely to get on well if you stand outside the office smoking or go drinking lots.  there is  a real lack of structure and process which means they do things quickly but end up doing it twice or doing it wrong because there's a lack of clear strategic planning. the top guys are well though of, the bottom rung work hard, but those in the middle - no one seems to know what they are doing. There's a big bullying culture here. And you need to be very thick skinned to survive. There's a very high turnover for a reason. people leave without even having jobs to go to, just to get out. ASOS wants to keep the young start up mentality, but they really could benefit from growing up a little.. Progression and development.  Impossible processes & systems.. Team/Department Politics, Lack of knowledge sharing across domains. The environment in the IT department seems to be that anything goes with regards to how things get done - resources poached from other teams to help get things done, last minute releases/fixes etc. Canteen really expensive Coffee shop should be subsidised. Senior management was a real challenge to engage with.  They need to do more to integrate sustainability into their core business model.. Can sometimes feel like there is so much we want to do and talk about doing, yet don't physically have the time to do it because of how fast-paced the environment is. I guess that's just down to prioritising workload.. This is my experience. If your pay is wrong there is little comeback. As regards flex hours you may be expected to begin shift two hours early at a moments notice and in spite of accumulating hours many employees' were asked to pay back hours! Ironically some were told to give back a week in overtime despite never being involved in any flex. When questioned HR would say they had access to information unavailable to Team Leaders rendering the Team Leader function a tad pointless. I feel HR didnt have control of the hours since being taken over twice. Oh and the handscanners are faulty so even though you can arrive in the car park 15mins early, by the time you use the clock in system inside it can reset and then go past the time expected in by a few seconds. Then the company charge you 15mins of pay for lateness. Targets are so high you can only achieve them by nearly breaking your neck, and if you have an accident you jeapordise employment. Good employees are treated like something on the bottom of your shoe, the lazy ones do well amazingly. Shift Managers waltz around like the second coming but I had no respect for the ones on despatch pick or pack. A Team Leader on Nights was the only one I respected but he's gone. Shame as now he has gone we have no one who takes us seriously, or treats us with dignity. Poor employer to work for.. Middle management politics! Too many contractors in IT for a very long time. Too many people trying to protect their own programs instead of looking at the bigger picture.  PMO could be utilise a lot more. Less politics and more direction leaders is needed.. CTO has issues. Either your part of his inner circle or he has no time for you. He knows best. Breaks the rules according to what suits him ( some very unethical ones) .Everyone else seems scared to disagree. Lost a lot of good people and will keep losing at this rate. Very political environment and rather cut throat. To survive basically dont challenge and query.. Too many Heads of Dept and too many getting promoted for who they know not what they know. Feels like you need to be a member of the good old boys club to further your career.. High growth business Constant pressure Changing properties. Cost and time of commuting. Systems can make work a bit manual and frustrating. Communication from management could be improved. some silly behaviors - immaturity at management level but think they need some training in how to deal with certain situations.. Open plan offices are too noisy.. Amazingly immature management. Whole IT team has talent in playing blamegames. Unethical behvaiour. Has a lack of direction, the company has many good ideas but due to high turnover at the top the plan is constantly changing. This can be frustrating for those wanting to see projects through to the end. It also means that you will work long hours. Whilst there are some great people there is also a lot of politics at the top.. The fact that its rapidly growing and evolving means it's a fast paced environment which may not suit everyone.. You're expected to put in very long hours and be on call 24/7.  The senior teams are very particular about who they favour and if you're not one of them, then you wont progress.  Other people in the business would go behind your back if it means they can get ahead.   Promotions are not based on value add to the business or quality of work. Flirting is seen as an acceptable way to win promotion.. I worked in the Customer Care team in London which was consisting out of 12-15 people from 5 different countries. We were the special advisors. My country team consisted of 3 people. One colleague was always listened to but us other 2 we were treated very special-. Throughout the whole team information was given only to the people who were good with the manager. we had 2 swaps within one year- the first leader really convinced me to speak about  if i would have a problem with my colleague. i said no cause I think these things need to resolve themselves -but he asked me in every one to one about it so that i thought he is interested and then I said what i do not like. Then the whole thing started. it broke up our team- instead of resolving it was always belived this one apparently only one knowledgeable member of the team and I feel betrayed for having said anything. Kept quiet went on working, Teamleader swap - became worse- the whole situation evolved again and that special person in our team got attention and everything and even in meetings with i higher perosn from the department the problem was not solved! It intoxicated my whole last months at ASOS becuase u felt like 2nd class people. Also in my reviews silly excuses were found that I do not reach the WELL DONE you need in order to be acknowledged or move to a different department whcih was my goal. I was not well done because I did a gap between a hiven and a capital letter and stuff like like this . I was always punctual or even over punctual at ASOS but even that meant nothing. The special person could be late 4 times a week ( yes we started counting and noted stuff) and they had always more cigarette breaks than others. Even behaving acc to the rules the next comment in my review was: You are better but still not welll done. No comment why on how instead poking on being sick one day! Was really not fair- felt useless with my colleague after a while and why they need us if the other person is so GREAT! This person btw was reluctant to show us stuff and always with a sigh and when I complained about it.they made a fuss ! Sorry for all these comments but I had a hell of 8 months there ( 3 were ok) and I seeked help but there was no support. and I want to make clear that this happened for Customer Care Specialists only! I love ASOS and what they offer to their employees really- by far the best I have seen. I left with a helpless sad and positive eye! I did not really want to leave but I needed to get out it affected my personal life and confidence.. can be all consuming...manage your time well and you will get the rewards. - Politics at senior management level - IT Changes are sometimes rushed through without proper testing - Turnover in I.T., there are some really good people who left. - Some teams/people can be quite clicky. team building activities could help with that.. Feedback not accurate Consistently criticised and not praised for what is done right Just a head's up, they will say \"can we have a chat?\" Take you off the floor for a couple minutes in front of everyone then tell you you're fired and have someone collect your things and literally show you the door. Happend to 20 people in the same day from different teams. The job is not secure considering most people who were being \"let go\" were only there for 1 or 2 months. Even being 1 minute late 3 times can cause you to be fired. You've been warned.. - not global thinking enough sometimes - sometimes fun comes before business! - workload is mad not giving you much time to think or be strategic on occassions. catty, negative towards assistant levels, a lot of overtime, lazy assistant buyers. - There's not enough space - desks are small and meeting rooms are always booked out - Things change...A LOT. I wouldn't recommend ASOS to someone who is not flexible or someone who doesn't like change - It can get very intense, it's busy all the time but mainly because people are really passionate about what they do. If you are a beginner in Customer Care rules are very strict. - Political - Unprofessional - Infantile - Arrogant - Treacherous. kpi is too high,no union on site,management don,t care about you,threat you like a slave,it is too long the list ,so if you can avoid this companny,they don,t care if you go or stay,you are only a number for them,. Over worked and under paid. Expected to work 12 hour days without  recognition or reward. I faced bullying from my manager, who made my life a misery by constantly putting me down and funnelling  her stress onto me and basically made my life hell. I reported her to HR but they didn't resolve anything.  Basically.. if you get on with your manger and he/she gets on with their manger you will be fine. if not you will have a tough time.. Upper Management and the way decisions are taken could lead to disappointment. Busy supervisors could/should be more present for their subordinates Long hours. overstaffed, weak members of staff. Poor middle management Inexperienced Team Leaders with poor micro-management skills Promotions based on popularity contests Treated like children. the whole place, from the top down all management have a bullying mentality and will get rid of you one way or another, they say there's no do's and don't's but done believe it! thats all the whole place is, questioned if you go to the toilet or make a drink, told off for being too productive, can never get holiday, all the bad reviews are true and the good ones are from people whose faces fit or have rose tinted glasses on, the latest news reports about the warehouse are true dispite being denied by executives! customer care is exactly the same and people need to see what asos are really like and how they treat their staff!. No career progression is possible. Cannot think of any at the moment. Company is growing very fast, you will need to keep up with everything.. Bad press which is a shame as the company seems to want the best for all it's employees and if there is a problem there are plenty of people that would love to get involved to change that.. Some areas still need a bit of improvement - such as in the QA leadership and some areas of the PMO. However I believe these are being addressed. if your face fits you'll be fine.. Chaos chaos chaos...everything happening very very and too fast. People that are more then 5 years there are marked and usually do not do much...except hiding knowledge to keep the status and being untouchable.. Terrible management. Low pay. HR doesn't care about employees hence the massive turnover at ASOS.. - Salaries aren't great - Big pushes to improve systems don't address underlying problems - Mostly a chaotic ride - Massive turnover of the best people - Layers and layers of tech debt (bad SQL, bad VB, countless architecture re-starts).. - not enough flexibility on dates of holidays - if you live in London, the commute is tiring  - you don't have your own desk. No progression - Colleagues allowed to get away with not working to standard. Inconsistent management, cliquey and often juvenile peers, lack of structure, and the HR team make far too many mistakes without ever fully resolving. Shift work, with a strong emphasis on conflicting early/late patterns.. - Maturity - Efficiency - Nothing else I can see. Wouldn't suit you if you don't like change and a fast pace. It's hard to move up the ladder. Compulsory 1 year needed in your role before you can move departments, even if you're skilled.. development is a little slow as it's a very set structure. Long hours!. Honestly i cannot think of any cons to working for ASOS that i have had even under the most stressful of times such as the site being down everything is handled amazingly and there is no real blame just learning experiences.. There's not quite enough space for all the new people but they're working on it. Also, sometimes being a big company makes it hard to get things done as quickly as they could be.. Useless and incompetent HR, no room for internal promotions, overstaffed, hot packed office, lots of politics, poor working conditions, too much lying.. Slow progress within the company. No real management support.. Questionable appointments to team leader roles, to say the least. This side of the company was expanding fast, so I can appreciate the need to fill the roles quickly, but it really was a case of whoever applied for such a role were either given it or asked to fill the role in probation form. It's great that they tried to promote from within, but some of the people were just not suitable for managerial type roles. It's as simple as that. Also towards the end of my time, they began to start taking privileges away from staff, in the name of efficiency. Not the way to motivate your staff or get them on side.. Slow Progression, but you do get there eventually The pay can be quite low. The workload can be very stressful. Stressful  Workload  Wage lower than work put in. - management - have to be a member of the 'old boys club' to get promoted. It's not the easiest place to work. It can be frustrating  at times and the turnover of staff is high.. 8 emails per hour target isn't always achievable - you can get a disciplinary for repeatedly having a low email average over shifts.   Progression can get political; managers know who they want to help.. Oppressive work environment. Unrealistic targets. Constant monitoring. Having to walk excessive distances of over 8 miles a day.  Not enough water stations. Timed toilet breaks.. Big company with lots or red tape and politics, mismanagement within team, hard to progress, favoritism, work can be monotonous at times.. - The job gets very repetitive  - Shift work. It's bad because the team is so young and not enough experience.. Working in Tech from a management/employee perspective is awful. There are a handful of really good managers who care about their staff. However, the others are simply greasy pole climbers who want to dine at the CEO's table and will do what it takes to get there.   There is no clear direction regards where is Tech is going. A likeable CIO has been unluky to have inherited a group of children to guide him. Am not going to mention names but avoid and Enterprise Architecture like the plague as it has caused more problems than solutions and if you want to commit career suicide, join Service Operations. A truly rank function that wouldn't know its backside from its elbow.. Huge Building so can get lost and IT Support can be delayed due to size of company but not really a 'con' - shows how well the company are doing !. extremely boring and stressful job bad management experience. Dispite the rules and processes Management use the egos to make up different one and contradict each other. Underqaulified and lazy Mangers some mangers are too scared to pick up the phone to call customers regarding their complainants and adviors have to do it. Managerment will shout and talk down to adviors.  A lot of offices politics. Staff can be very Cliqy as every one knows each other and some have generations of the family working there.  The old office was very dirty. You have to sale you sole to progress and for some that still isn't enough. You will be promoted for exerimental processes then demoted.. management to ridge, way to much inter office politics. Pay could be a lot better.. Myself and several others I know, have had a terrible experience with bullying here! The name calling, nasty remarks, rumours and career progression sabotage doesn't just stop with other customer advisors, some of the team leaders and senior staff also enjoy getting involved! During my ordeal here, I suffered with workplace depression, this was just labelled as attention seeking or drama. If I, or others tried to confide in management about the bullying it would just result in victim blaming and you'd be seen as the problem! An older team leader would often send inappropriate messages to young advisors, I too received these and was later pestered for a date. I was treated badly and humiliated here right up to the end of my last day. It really was awful! After leaving, I needed counselling for depression and anxiety. I am still affected by the experience now. I have heard from remaining employees that the bullies have found new victims and so it continues.. Sometimes stressful,  very often short handed. - The company is massively expanding so there are some building works going on at the moment. Expected to work very long hours. My team wasn't very well managed and failing badly which resulted in a bad atmosphere and limited support. being managed like a child - although a lot of are young.. Some staff very careless due to trying to hit high targets.. Not always room for career progression it can take a while to progress to next level.  Flexi time isn't really flexi time as it has to be agreed in advance. - becomes more and more corporate - new management coming in is attempting to turn it into M&S - no chance for internal career progression. No progression. Need to be popular have things. High turn over. Salary is not great, although it's adequate if we consider the benefits. Sometimes there are a lot of bureaucracies and a bit of disparity between teams in the technology department. Deadlines are sometimes not realistic and quality can suffer because of that.. - Rapidly expanding company so culture shift is happening, but that means more responsibility on people to self manage themselves and their careers (so not really a con but still watch out) - Not much governance and processes in place so larger projects tend to be frustrating to work on. At the moment there is quite a bit of building works on the office to cater for the expanding workforce, so it maybe noisy at times.. - Not as agile as it could be, although continuously improving on that front. - Teams still lack autonomy.. Takes forever to progress, workload can be really intense, low pay. You are expected to work well beyond your contracted hours and made to feel bad if you leave work on time- I was asked on several occasions so come in on the weekend to work for no extra money/time in lieu!! It is extremely fast paced and as the company is 24/7, you are expected to work non-stop without any flexibility. The pay generally is also very poor considering the size of the company and competitors out there. Recruitment process was also poor- people got hired because of WHO they know, not how good or qualified they are.. Have to switch shifts all the time, sometimes working until 11. Constant monitoring, system is like school. The targets they set are unrealistic, you should do a certain amount of emails/live chats/social an hour and it just isn't possible some days. One to ones you have every week with your team leader are very hard - if you make one mistake you are made to feel guilty about it and as if you are failing every aspect in life - almost a bullying tactic. The company offer no support if you are struggling or having problems outside of work. Team leaders would go missing for hours on end and therefore my team had no one to help us except the odd team leader you could find.  Most team leaders didn't have a clue about half of the policies and I feel that does not set a good example at all for new people. One last thing is keep an eye on what you say to anyone there, there are always people higher up than you watching you and monitoring you. Never discuss anything personal with your team leader or share any opinions on anything with them, they claim your conversations with them are \"confidential\" and make you feel like you're their friend, they're not. They write down everything you say and relay it all back to their management, even private things - which a company is not strictly allowed to do. All in all - would avoid working for this company.. Turnover is really high in tech, company losing great people constantly. Service ops full of corporate climbers, doesnt represent the company or brand at all. Young people wanting to move to other areas of the business or have left in general. Politics and clique groups. Where do I start? BULLYING, this place is a playground for sociopathic morons who if they see you as a threat will 'investigate' you for stirring your coffee too  many times. They will dumb you down, you can't use 'big' words their banned because they don't understand them. They treat you like rats in cages; they have colour codes for your productivity- it will start reasonable; 3 an hour and then it will get ridiculous; 10+ customers so that's live chats, emails, social the works you'll be expected to diagnose, read through the chain and notes in 2 minutes with a cherry on top, they also monitor your 'quality' so expect to complete the feats of a robot for 11000 a month after tax. They lure you in with a 700 pound bonus if you pass probation, but the jokes on you because you only get  it  6 months after passing probation! This company will have you jumping through hoop after hoop and will exploit your desire to do well. You're under constant surveillance; expect  a battleaxe to be walking around sniffing out for a DPA  breach which is just being on your phone around the computers. Once you pass your probation though you can work from home? If they let you go you will be humiliated and escorted out of the building by security.. Do not support mental health HR do not support you Some teams are very clique and use bully tactics No one to speak to when in trouble Do not train you properly if at trainee level. This is a cliquey place and cliques are kings. From day one you will understand, if the clique accepts you, and then they will set the pace for you. You won't have much choice, you will eventually succumb to what the clique dictates. If the clique doesn't like you, the backstabbing will start almost immediately and it will be ferocious and merciless. You will find no friendly soul, no person to confess your thoughts, no friend. Everybody 100% will do their best to bring you down to your knees. If you don't leave by your own accord, they will eject you.. This place is absolutely horrible. Please ASOS do not reply to this message with an automatic response saying that this is not the case. I worked there long enough to see what kind of place it is.   The advisors are constantly monitored, if you don't log in on time you will be told off even if it was a work related conversation. The weekly one to one  feedback is even worse, according to them it is our moment to shine but the truth is far from that.  They will just tak about how to improve the quality score of your response and the productivity report.   Management is really underqualified, half the advisors working there have more qualifications than them.   They didn't even let me quit in peace, management was constantly gossiping about me until the day I left. I couldn't even say goodbye to colleagues properly.. shift patterns make making plans difficult. Pointless one 2 ones each week.  New inexperienced team managers, who where out to save their own skin rather than help, didnt know the processes, so couldnt turn to them for help, when stuck in 3 live chats and need advice quickly.turnover of staff a joke. The disperance in pay between team leaders and customer service advisor, when they didnt seem to know what they where doing. if they paid them a reasonable wage, maybe everyone will get paid a reasonable wage. 3 live chats at a time. It was like being on the phone with 3 people at a time.  Awful.. ASOS have policies put in place for a reason, like most work places. There have been a few reviews about productivity/quality and what people are expected to do... ASOS expect you to try your best. Some people cant and won't understand the policies but if you have a good work ethic then you would have no problem with this as you would be doing the right thing and following the guidelines.. Not a single thing  !! - I honestly cant think of anything. Shiftwork, which isn't great for personal life - 6am- 12pm. It's not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend working here if you're looking for a 9-5 and you're not truly passionate about your role or the company's mission. This is a not a company culture where you can  'phone it in'. You can have a work/life balance here, but it's easy to get swept up in everything that's happening.. Nothing - not that I can think of anything!. Treated like school children. Training inconsistent and processes absolutely horrendous for such a large company.. - Growing pains - Promotion and growth opportunities limited - Constantly changing strategies in Tech and poor connection between Tech Leadership Team and rest of Tech team. Worse place I have ever worked in my life. They treat you like a child in primary school, the Team Leaders are absolutely useless have no idea what they are doing all they do is walk around looking for answers as they are clueless. If you want to work in a company where you want to progress DO NOT apply for ASOS as 90% off the Team Leaders have come from other companies and have not been a Customer Care Advisor before. They watch everything you do like Big Brother there will give you stupid one to one meeting which is completely pointless and irrelevant. They FORCE you to call customers even though you have told them you aint comfortable doing them as you not familiar with all the processes yet, when in actual fact its the Team Leaders job to do it. When a member of staff has been sacked or had there probation extended everyone knows about it. The Team Leader I had was a BULLY he use to shout at us when we are not hitting our targets we couldnt even book a holiday with out being questioned he wants to know why we are taking the holiday and we have to ask him for a holiday even though it has been authorised already. Also was told to kiss the top managers bum to keep my job. When you have made a minor mistake they bring you into a room in front of everyone and tell you off like a child couldnt wait to leave this company.  AVOID ASOS. Alot of office politics and favouritism. The customer care centre is poor run by ego. childish managers treating the advisors like children. You cant even go to the loo when you want. you are monitored tirelessly and patronised. There is a bery high turn over of staff.. Can't think of any cons. Team member should be briefed on the role of the intern and how they should delegate work Managers can be flaky with guidance  Competitive. Literally everything, security being horrendously tight, worked until you drop, sexual harassment to female employees, accused of being drunk, attacked by another employee.. Boring Shift It seems like a school. Unrealistic Pace/ Very 'Clique' at senior manager level. As a relatively young company it lacks the structure of other organisations, but makes up for it through atmosphere and working environment.. Prepared to be ignored if you're not part of the boys club The Tech teams are run by a bunch of bullies, it's their way or no way, even if their way is the wrong way Hard work and results are often over looked, and people are based on who they know  If you're a female in Tech don't expect to be paid anything near your (junior) co-workers. Low salary for entry level jobs. Quite informal, catty advisors to team leaders to performance managers, They lie when they say it's easy to progress. The discount was just amazing !. Not that I can think of!. I was sacked for literally being 3 minutes late when another girl on my team (white) came in late 25 minutes and was regularly late. No one said a thing to her. Manager was obviously bias and much friendlier with the white people on the team. I had been performing very well in all other areas but being one of the only ones on the team who lived a little further away I had had a few lates (max 8 mins) which I was always happy to make up at the end of the day. Shifts were terrible, your social life is non-existent with the crazy shifts you're given and they still have the cheek to constantly ask you to do more overtime.  I failed probation because of being 5 minutes late and even though the manager knew this she wouldn't tell me when I asked her at the beginning of my shift. I told her I felt sick and just wanted to know. She made me continue doing the work and said that there was nothing to worry about. My uncle had passed away the night before and by the time they finally arranged a probation review meeting to dismiss me and end my contract I was feeling very sick and I burst out into tears. They are honestly so harsh and they don't pay their employees much and try to make up for it in 'benefits'. Not acceptable.. Unfortunately people take advantage and dont pull their weight. Too much middle management Too many stakeholders Lots of politics. 3 sign off segments before being promoted. Only have opportunities be signed off twice in the year. Slow progression.. AGILE DELIVERY Managers are generally poor developers from other companies trying their hand at management. ASOS are not good at hiring good managers, I've only had one that I've completely respected and he was promoted twice, rightly so.   Poor understanding of the progression process, the skills chart has been updated so many times, no one really knows how to get a promo outside of the pub..  Facade of women in tech initiatives recently to push equality for women, when again women are still not getting equal pay. A wide spread adjustment was done very recently to try and address the difference in pay gap without mentioning exactly the reason why.. Shift work, nothing else to say. The best company I have been so far.  Hands down.. politics, made to work like robots.. Such a high turnover on all levels right to the top. That the management style , rules and office culture was always turbulent.   At time it was like a high school.. Lack of training programmes/materials Poor management. * Was not placed in the division that I interviewed for, which is absurd (and hence i did not stay long at this org) * My initial line manager was a condescending bully with numerous complaints against him * Some of the people were awful - dismissive, belittling etc. * \"Just do it\" attitude held by many managers * BIG boozing culture * Flexible working initiative not consistently implemented * The criteria for BA career progression was extremely opaque. The process was not explained during the interview process even though I very specifically asked about it * The division seemed obsessed with the process of delivery and not delivery itself; suffice to say our team delivered very little and I left because I felt this was going to look very bad on my CV * The staff turnover in tech was laughable (so high). -Politics. -Undermining and backstabbing. -Complete lack of professionalism (especially some Directors and their Mini Me Wannabes) -Heavy drinking and drugs culture (inc within the office). -Do as I say culture (dont do as I do, as I am superior)- hypocrites galore!  -Some vindictive personalities, especially within Tech -Bullying and Discrimination- discriminatory subculture exists (language and actions permeate directly from the CEO)  -Presents a holier than thou facade, everything from ethical trade to working conditions and equal ops- none of which is backed up.. It's chaotic and not in a good 'fast paced' way. It is just hugely frustrating on a daily basis.   Senior Management don't deal with poor Line Managers either.   Too many people involved in a sign off process.  Very hard to progress up through the company - there's no support from HR to do this either - so the only way to do this is leave.  For some departments, it's all about politics and egos.. The hours you have to put in are long, a healthy worklife balance isn't always possible.. - Still a corporate, things take time, lots of stakeholders. - Some incompetency in mid/senior management results in weak leadership and confusion. A lack of willingness to stand up and be counted on difficult decisions.  - The fashion side of the business often does not know what it wants, making it hard to know whether the work done will deliver any real value.  - Central teams who seem permanently unavailable, making necessary infrastructure changes near impossible, frequently blocking entire teams  - Somewhat chaotic and noisy environment at times  - Unprofessional/disrespectful behaviour in certain teams with management either participating or turning a blind eye.  - Significant unaddressed technical debt in some areas meant some teams were heavily coupled, causing significant pain in releasing.. If you dont fit in with the clique from day 1 you may as well leave. Management more bothered about hiding the truth so they look good. The bullying tactics used by MANAGEMENT seem to be the best way to get ahead.   On the outside its painted as a social fun place to work. Thats just code for drug taking and coasting through sign offs because youre part of the right clique.   Key words: backstabbing, fake, drugs, bullies, cliques, mismanagement, no mental health support, sexist, boys club, non empowering, no work life balance, poor salary.  When youre 21 and dont understand what a workplace should really be like. No one at ASOS will tell you otherwise or try to help. Not cool when its detremental to peoples mental health.. Difficult to move up with so many people working there.  Different standards held for different teams largely depending on leaders and managers. Very fast pace and changing, competition for progression. I have noting to fault about the role or the people.. No profession, can't keep up with the growth in Customer Care, don't get feedback from their advisors even though they are the ones dealing with customers every day.. Difficult to find Team Leader/Manager when there are problems so can effect performance.. long hours , can be tiring and stressful. Poor understanding of technical function and the technical director is very demotivating. - Bad leadership, very top down decisions - Central teams dictate how the platforms should work - Waterfal driven by big programs - Architecture decides everything before engaging the development teams, which at this point is too late to change. It feels like like im back in school sometimes and Id rather get more money than have drinks at work etc. theres very often no communication or a lot of miscommunication between the senior management and advisors. Theres no consistency in managing styles and there are a lot of people who should never be a part of the management.. Left on your own and hard to find help if needed. Teams are divided, if you get a good team, great, if you don't, you could experience some petty behaviour typical of fashion industries. Also you are VERY replaceable, which is a good thing too, but in my experience, people/managers didn't always keep to their word if they promised something.. - This is a retailer, not a technology company. The majority of the business sees tech & product management as \"IT\".   - Product management largely sidelined due to organisational structure, separated accountability  - Fundamentally not a very evidence-based or data-driven business, but politically-driven; priorities usually set top-down by the \"highest paid person's opinion\"  - Don't seem to promote based on merit, but years experience/age & politics. Results in employees' focus not being on delivering value for the business, but what politics they need to navigate to get promoted. Very often leads to incompetent leadership who can \"talk-the-talk\", but could never \"walk-the-walk\"  - Very frustrating place to work - huge opportunities that no-one is working on.  - Massive (very waterfall) change programs have slowed almost all forms of iterative development or innovation down to a stop  - Bloated, with many employees doing very little of value.  - Company takes the approach of throwing people at problems, as opposed to (usually very simple) use of technology to solve them.. Truly, cannot think of any. Hard to think of any. - Due to growth office is split in two locations.. Retail pay is atrocious, not competitive at all to my knowledge. Many people leave ASOS, go to Arcadia and come back on a higher pay grade and job title. Office politics exist everywhere so that's negligible Many levels to Promotions. Each JD is tiered: Entry Lvl 1/Established Senior To move up you must be assessed and or signed off. This happens every 6-12months in March & September. If you start in Feb, or Aug you have limited time to learn the role then prove your worth. So will need to work very hard to step up 2 roles. Doing your job is not enough to be levelled up. You must be doing the role above to be signed off. You have no opp to show you can you must be already doing it. Workload can be great.. Working in the ASOS studios was one of the worst experiences of my life and badly effected my mental health. I had to suffer bullying at the hands of my team leader (who had received previous complaints prior to my employment) and handle everything entirely on my own, despite my cry for help to HR (on two occasions). It was only when I resigned that they decided to listen but even then my complaint was never taken seriously. The HR department are completely for the company and are not too concerned with the wellbeing of the individual employee. The management I was under are entirely inexperienced, socially inept and unprofessional. They are allowed to abuse their position of authority without being challenged. I'm sure many of my previous employees would agree that it is more like being back at school rather than in a professional working environment. I have heard more recently that people have had mental breakdowns working here, and I was on the verge. Don't be fooled by the amazing benefits and working culture, believe me, it's not worth it! As I've learnt, it's far more important to have a healthy working environment and supportive management with good morals than having parties and cheap clothes!. You can never find your team leader if you need help with something. They expect you to not make mistakes when you've been there a day, you are expected to hit your targets straight away and get told to hurry up if you don't. Don't even think about having a day of ill otherwise you are gone.. My employment was terminated due to a few reasons, some for not following process when I was only just taught it and one of which was a fabricated reason from a leader. It was that my behavior did not suit the requirements of the role customer care advisor and that it is not acceptable to say things like 'Thanks Mate' or  'cheers bro' to the Team Leader. There was no statements taken from either side or any investigation concluded, it was just taken as fact that I must've said it. Even though I did not know this until I was in the meeting my employment was being terminated in.  All I can say is, if they don't like you personally then they will do whatever they need to, to get rid of you. Even if that means making things up likemy leader did. They also have a negative snappy attitude towards workers but this is more due to the type of Leaders that were training my group at the time, the others seemed fine.  On the plus side the termination went smoothly and respectively.. Inexperienced management, office politics, long serving employees cruising and not adding any value. No clear career progression, information not shared. Promotion is little bit difficult. Not many cons to share. Bullying becoming more and more common with a growing blame culture and unfriendly teams. Management promoted on their technical skills and constantly lack the ability to step up manage their people. Lots of cliques and catty behaviour. HR are disorganised and ignore any real issues. They will always side with the most senior person in the room. Work life balance is non/existent- if you are given the rare opportunity to work slightly fewer days you are expected to still do your full time job in that time....with less pay. Health and well-being is promoted as important to the company but realistically they will ignore any problems and class it as underperformance.. Bad communication, lack of career progression paths. No cons, the IT department is broken down into smaller teams. Every team varies.. You get some feedback when you did something wrong about the process. Sometimes, it is kinda of tricky as the processes changes all long. They are attentive to employees feedback.. Monotonous tasks, job is very boring and repetitive. Long hours (I work nights, 4 on 4 off).. No bonus sometimes long hours. I dont really have any cons to be honest. Job progression, salary, very different to other businesses. Bad pay, they play on their benefits. Takes a ages to get promoted.. sometimes felt like it was a huge organisation perhalsp bigger than i am used to, which is purely personal. obviously the company could afford you the same opportunitties if it wasnt so large, not sure if its a con as such - more that it said i had to fill this out. Retail sector is volatile, pressure, stress, competitive atmosphere, unrewarding work (personal opinion). The only thing - far from London center. Hot desking Little progression Quiet office /awkward. the building is old and uninspiring but is currently being  refurbished!. ASOS has built a great business as a marketing  x IT business. As a result there is a monolithic tech presence organised around platforms not customer needs, preferring to take a shopping list of features than explore an ambiguous space and test and learn their way to creating true customer value.   In many ways this is a corporate IT structure from 2005.   The organisation remains heavily  siloed and the suggestion of cross functional teams working towards a metric-focussed outcome is treated with suspicion by tech leadership. One suspects because it threatens their power base.   There is a strategic vacuum at the top, meaning everyone decides what they think is important. This changes on a weekly basis as plans go out the window to chase short term wins.  I'm ultimately frustrated I couldn't do more to establish a different way of working but it was a tough sell in this environment I guess - you can lead a horse to water.... Theres a lot of support and maintenance which makes a developer bored  The office is too busy and noisy  Not enough writing code. Big corporation with a lot of management.. - People talk behind your back  - No room for progression unless you are friends with a lot of the TLs  - No support  - TLs are under the age of like 21 and have no clue what they are doing  - The wrong people progress. lack of real innovation, mismanagement of resources (financial, people), short sighted as to  the industry future, focused on short term sales, general fear of doing new things, london-centric mentality,. Too much stress for such little pay. No recognition for all your work. Everything went to the managers favourite member of staff. Not enough support from management and HR. Had to leave due to being too ill from stress with no help or contact from HR even though they said they would. Rude and arrogant management - They knew they were higher than you.... Very catty!!! I expected this as its fashion but not to that extent. Felt like I was back at school. No exit interview to ask how they could improve.. shows they didn't care how and why I left. All talk and no actions. Extremely over worked. From the outside ASOS seems an amazing company as everyone only posts the fun/ exciting things about ASOS but its not true.. This are very slow to release. when money is tight there are people doing 3 peoples jobs and people who deserve to be promoted aren't. Need to listen to the people in mid level positions more before making decisions which impact their job on the software they use. Also need to remember what people are inspired by, using all money for certain events where we're unsure of the purpose instead of salaries doesnt feel right.. -Gender pay gap -Promotions structure is not clear at all, women especially dont get the same opportunities  Very strong underlying sexism culture  they have allowed harassment and bullying  Completely unsupportive and disgusting treatment if you suffer from mental health(they will likely reply to this with a whole copy and paste job about how they dont tolerate sexism and they support mental health, DONT believe the hype) I am not the first and i wont be the last woman to leave because of it!Despite their shiny image and many benefits HR will always put senior management first and not take lower down employees opinions seriously. Its a very toxic work environment.   I strongly advise not to work in technology here or ASOS in general. I worked here for over 5 years and really gave it a chance but ASOS did not ever really change their ways. There are way more tech roles in London where you will be valued, respected and rewarded. Dont be fooled by the first 5 glass door reviews on here that are all positive most likely and written by ASOS HR, dig a little deeper and take on board the real honest reviews.. Everything is a Con! I don't even know where to start. No chance for career growth, especially for non english speakers. You are treated like a kid. There are so many problems within each market and the management just pretend everything is ok, they don't work to help costumers but just to look good to the CEO eyes. Over hiring: there are many many teams that do NOTHING all day or all night long, but they keep hiring people from outside so the good employees only have to leave. I will never understand why they do this. Constant hiring of mediocre people while they should only keep the good ones. They also keep creating new teams that absolutely make no sense. Micromanagement: Team leaders need to act like kindergarten teachers because their workload is ridiculously low so they just wonder around telling everyone off it they look at their phone or if they speak in another language, they really do not know how to keep busy.. - Your rights are exploited: - you get in trouble for using the toilet for longer than 5 minutes! this will also get used against you for reviews.  -get in trouble or sacked if your off sick -get in trouble or sacked if your late even though you have legitimate reasons.  -if your going through personal crises the team leader will use it against you to get rid of you.  -a lot of favoritism happens here. Unless you are kissing the team leaders back side you won't pass probation or progress.  there are some really good staff there who have been in the same position for a very long time and they are not progressing simply because the team leader and manager doesn't like them as their personal favorite pet.   -many of the team leaders don't even like doing their job - which is to help and aid staff! they want to just sit there and gossip.  -staff are young and immature, no good worth ethics and use passive aggressive attitude to get their way.  -lie on feed back forms. some information even get erased.  -it's like being in prison. You get told off for the most ridiculous things.  -Most of the team leaders and managers apply rules to staff they don't abide by.  -working on rota and weekends can really exhaust you. the pay is not worth it. -people end up feeling depressed there -poor ventilation and poor hygiene practice. Sometimes promotions are up to financials (even though the company has a VERY stable financial background) Mobile development is not agile, more like waterfall There are no feature squads, but teams are made from homogenous members (a team is all web devs or android devs for example). Cant think of any, fast paced and a lot of work like any job worth having.. Low wage, shift patterns that change weekly. Hard to progress. Shift patterns.. Do your physical and mental well-being a favour and avoid ASOS like the plague.   As a company, theyll go to any length to protect their precious public reputation and to scaremonger their employees to avoid word being spread of the evil and vindictive work culture that goes on behind the scenes in their offices.  When you start your job with them, youll be sold a dream of an employer that values their staff, drives personal development, as well offering great benefits e.g. staff discount, free onsite gym membership, monthly free alcoholic beverages on shift etc (which youll end up relying on, to help you cope with their diabolical management), but it doesnt take long before the cracks begin to show in their cleverly executed facade.   Youll have their company values to be Authentic, Brave and Creative drilled into you from the get-go, yet youll find yourself penalised and labeled as a troublemaker if they dont like what you have to say.   Progression and promotion opportunities arent rewarded to the loyal and hardworking employees, instead, theyre given to those individuals that spend all of their time gossiping with and sucking up to Team Leaders on company time, rather than doing the work theyre being paid to do.   Passion and dedication to your role go unnoticed, but theyll be quick to reprimand you for getting up from your desk to grab a glass of water, being a few minutes late back from your break or lunch or god forbid being off sick when you are unwell. This results in extremely high staff turnover and leaves people feeling deflated and unworthy. The number of staff absences related to mental health issues triggered by the workplace is at an all-time high.   In July 2018, ASOS signed the Time to Change pledge, stating they are committed to supporting those with mental health conditions without judgement and yet on returning to work, you are asked patronising questions in a formal documented interview, designed to make you feel guilty and ashamed, such as Do you understand the impact your absence had on the business?, which sounds extremely judgement if you ask me.   If the management at ASOS had an ounce of compassion for their employees, theyd realise that they are not robots, so they shouldnt be treated like one. Its about time that they open their eyes and use their ears to start actually listening to the feedback of their staff and addressing the serious flaws within their working culture before its too late.. shift work, busy, loud office. progression has slowed down a lot recently. Good company i dont see any cons. shifts, middle management, inconsistent pay. Whilst interviewing the company tells you how much they like to push their employees and how much space to grow there is. However if you work for the office in Watford you will have have almost no chance to move up and change to the London office, even if your skills are amazing, they rather hire externally. A lot of talented people get stuck there and can't build their career the way they wanted.. Many people who work here suffer a decline in their mental health. This is known and ignored by management. Long hours, pay just above minimum wage. This is the kind of workplace that makes you work the job that you're aspiring too for 18 months to 2 years before they take your applications seriously. If you do get a promotion you'll be working alongside external applicants who get paid more than you however have little to no understanding of how to do the role meaning internal applicants get paid less to do more as they have to pick up the slack.. Lack of diversity in management.  Gender pay gap.  Shareholders are more important than employees.. was there for a few months and was sent home because of lack of work at least 1 or twice a week was bad when you travel for over an hour to get there and only work 2-3 hours.. Feel like your in prison. With the strictness on being late after lunch or break by even 1 minute.. Shift patterns can be unrealistic for your body clock. If your a minute back from your lunch its like you have committed a crime. You have to ask to go to the toilet which they monitor. No progression. Poor pay.. long hours strict management racist mangers not enough money same music everynight. Bad communication  School like environment  Patronising Managers  Treated like a child  Repetitive  Low salaries. The social aspect of the company is being cut drastically, with no more xmas parties and cutting benefits such as discounts. None at all what so ever. Mediocre pay, not very stimulating, extremely process driven. Poor for development if you are at a lower level as they do not allow you to take any further responsibilities which means you can never learn/ gain real experience until you go to a different role somewhere else or stay in the hopes someone will leave and you can apply for their job.  Communication can be poor and often feels like you voice is not heard.. Redundancies happening everywhere - at a moments notice. Interview process was slow.. Management and the amount of pressure they put on you. Shift patterns were long.. Lack of management internally  promised bonus and not received. Culture and benefits are changing a lot, not for the good either! Cutting back is evident, which effects the employee experience. High staff turnover which can be off putting. Pay and discount, work environment is fun. - unprofessional, racist management - lack of structure and policies - no clear guidance on progression - not customer oriented - cool kids club  - lies used to lure people into the business - minimal sick days - horrible pay - terrible connection to leavesden - lots of pressure on advisors and staff - overcrowded building - terrible canteen food - drug culture - uneducated managers and no support - a joke of HR (people team) their HR advisors are not trained and everybody sat in their will give you a different advice, instead of speaking to each other and advising one  or the same advice - hypocritical behaviour e.g. asos advocates for gender equality, not racially motivated etc. but are the worst when it comes to racist jokes, sexist remarks and homophobia. Salary is way below market rate, and the way promotions work resemble a popularity contest.. Once you've 'learned the ropes' the work isn't challenging, most of the hard problems have already been solved and much of the work is boiler plate rinse and repeat.  If you're looking for pure software development then you may be disappointed, the software engineer role is more DevOps so much of the job is scripting and managing configuration where much of the job is spent in a web browser battling the tooling (although there are initiatives to solve this long term).  Not all the work is greenfield, much of the system is still in 'legacy' and thus you'll be dealing with horrible big balls of mud, but this is part and parcel of most companies.  They are very slowly trying to migrate to cloud based solutions but this process will take several years.. Overcrowded workplace where often some people are bringing their personal feelings and willing to deal with arguments from outside inside of a workplace.. There are so many changes happening at ASOS that its hard to keep up. Director has very little knowledge of the business, very little knowledge of what garment technology at ASOS entails, is very impersonal and extremely demotivating. They has made so many changes to GT that it is no longer representative of garment technology as a whole - it seems as though GT is being phased out all together. They've made so many wrong decisions and has limited progression and removed so many processes that during their time there, we've lost over half of the original garment tech team and they are not back-filling either, meaning that workload is pilling up and techs are being signed off with stress (all of which management/HR doesn't seem to care about- no support is offered) There is not a single member of garment technology which is happy in their job.  There is little to no training given when you start - I was being trained up by other assistants who had started not long before I had.  ASOS as a whole are struggling massively, morale is absolutely terrible as more and more perks are slowly being removed. Redundancies are being made left, right and centre  and its very common to be walking through corridors/go to the toilets/walk around the canteen and see someone crying.  When I started almost 2 years ago, ASOS was a happy and exciting place to work, however have fallen onto hard times but has become very corporate (something they promised wouldn't happen) in that time, causing a lot of anger and frustration with current employees.  It's a very hard time to be working in the Retail part of ASOS due to cutting headcount and upping the option count, meaning that there is too much work to keep up with, too much for the amount of people they have.  I also have suspicion that many Glassdoor reviews which are popping up are fake.   It is hard to list every bad aspect of GT currently so the best way to describe it is: Garment Technology is an amazing, fun and creative profession to have, however, ASOS is not the place to practice that profession right now. Times used to be different but as long as they have the vision which is currently being rolled out, you will not be respected or be happy as a garment tech there. Perhaps in a few years, things may improve, but right now, I wouldn't bother - for your own happiness, mental health and career.. The promotion scheme is deceiving: you can nail your objectives and it doesn't guarantee you a promotion whatsoever; \"well done, maybe next year\". The web team is crippled with managers and technical figures that are long past their prime. Product teams, design teams and development teams work in silos, making the everyday completely uninspiring.. Poor retention of staff, senior management chaotic.  Long hours, grown too quickly and lacks good working practices.. Young unexperienced employees are given carte blanche festering bullies that will do nothing good for your career and making your expertise and energy worthless, The HR department called PX is the most unhelpful department. Young admins are the gateway to nowhere. Overall the company values look great on paper but the reality is completely different and very disappointing. Feels like school  Inconsistency  Poor communication.. Lack of communication from the top to the bottom. Lots! expectation of delivery remains constant even though the numbers have gone down.. Management becoming more like Arcadia, reducing benefits. Reaction and change - working in a fast paced and changing environment is to be expected in any growing company but ASOS tried too quickly to grow itself. A 'chuck money at problems' attitude.  No confidence when collaborating with other members of the team leader community due to lack of management by their manager or experience.  Nepotism is rife within customer care and most 'support' teams are made up of friends who've been given free reign to offer roles to those who have zero experience.  Development opportunities are more of a popularity contest than of deserved applications - which shows in the recent cull of people at management level. There has been a restructure due to business issues which has seen over a hundred people made redundant due to bad business decisions made the last few years.  No-one ever really seems to be pulling in the same direction - too many members of management have difference of knowledge but not in a positive way (this is down to too many senior management only having knowledge of ASOS as a business - which is an issue since the customer care department has grown).  Very specific, but the term 'perception is reality' being used by high level management as a way of judging people's ways of working or personalities within their roles. This is frightening considering the amount of people that work within customer care.  Rumours, bitchiness and college-like feel about the place is the absolute worst. It is like being back at school (that's just the management).  The current CEO.. You don't get a discount when purchasing online as full-timers do.. Terrible management Stupid processes No opportunity to growing up. business has grown faster than the leadership and infrastructure. Very little progression and pay rises.. All other events are cancelled, which includes: Christmas parties, summer parties, Friday drinks and other engaging and fun activities No free fruit Poor communication between departments, you will never receive an answer for anything, new processes are sloppy and not well though through. No opportunity for progression or growth, due to recent company cutbacks.  All vacancies have been removed No certainty about anything Overconfident management, who are not even competent to do their job and just got the position, because they work in the company for a long time.. Massive workload, feels unmanageable at times Difficult to progress Competitive. Incredibly inexperienced senior managers, who are not qualified to do the role they were fortunate enough to be quickly promoted in to, right place right time approach, inherent favouritism. No structure.. better perks would be nice!. Too many people for one job, not much to do, poor mid Level management. Try to mould you into the same people. Say theyre flexible working are not in practice. very clique within teams,  personal development has become less of a focus over the years.. Many middle managers just don't do much or have any impact. C*O to this day is the most boring person I've ever met. I avoided going to any of his meeting  unless I want to sleep.. Like any customer service job is ripetitive and pretty boring.. - Exec board are out of touch with most departments - Sometimes it can feel hard to get some work off the ground - Redundancies were recently enforced. The handling of this was terrible.  - Sometimes its hard to progress (speaking on behalf of myself and multiple people across the business). Even when you do, pay rises were minimal although work could double or triple.. the unrealistic targets abd bad enviroment. Work environment can sometimes be hostile and tense, friends move up to higher places than hard workers and HR and management can see the inner politics and don't really care enough to fix it. Some people are given better treatment than others based on who you are friends with. Many people have left recently after being driven out by these tense and stressful working environments.. Lots of legacy systems, but that could also be a unique challenge for some. The company is currently going through a lot of change which can be disorienting.. tied very closely to MS stack. not much growth for architect overlapping roles and responsibilities causes friction between engineers and architects.. Not a lot of communication with the contact centre managers.. Management reduced the amount of benefits due to latest market results. Not allowed any breaks when you go to the toilet you have someone follow you too make sure your not having a break  some staff are ignorent and don't speak to you including management. Being  scrutinised for being a couple minutes late to work/break/lunch. Feeling like youre in prison. The fact there are some team leaders that think they can act as they please and when you do make a formal complaint, it doesnt go anywhere. Instead they fire you for it and give you some bs reason, like your performance isnt good enough. God forbid youre sick or have some personal problems going on, they dont care. They never really acknowledge the good youve done, they focus on the bad. I personally believe that some people have some sort of God complex about themselves and I honestly believe some of the people there have suffered some sort of a traumatic experience because the way they treat you its as if youre the reason for their pain, so you should suffer.. Challenging commute from central London. unethical progression based on favouritism horrible hours work every 2 weekends in a month makes you brain dead. some people pull their weight more than others.. Uninspiring and removed leadership.. Salary, no career progression. No career progression to manager role. Feedbacks are not always welcome, and when they are with data and analysis, not taken in consderation. No flexibility with shifts Canteen with not very healthy food. Many benefits being removed.. High level of mico-management, not much flexibility. Clogged with rude, unprofessional lazy middle managers. A lot of hardworking talented people at the bottom who have no opportunity for progression. No pay rises for 2 years (unless youre management). All the company perks have either been removed or had restrictions placed on them. People crying at work everyday. Forced to work overtime unpaid regularly. Workplace is a health and safety nightmare, people severely injured at work, Asos weasel their way out of it being their fault. No one wants to be there.. -Terrible pay  -gender pay gap  -poor management  - bad sustainability  -no progression -high staff turnover. beirachracy was a bit too much. No Fixed shifts Working weekends sometimes. Not great pay, hard to get promoted or make a difference.. Terrible shift patterns left me tired all the time and affected my relationships. Upper management does not have a clue.. Progression is extremely slow so you dont feel appreciated. Management doesn't know/care what's going on in teams, and salaries are far below average.. Senior management make frequent bad decisions. Pay not aligned with industry rate, across all lower levels. Sizeable wage gaps. highly corporate environment and lots of meetings. Too many to mention. too much micro managing no flexibility on lateness management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising shift patterns are pretty bad, knowing a sizeable amount of people commute in from London via public transport. no opportunities for progression within, lack of functions to manage team, lack of basic kpi's (removed and new ones not fully introduced at this stage: 6 months later), serious lack of support from senior management, no training / no development (1 year in role), no accountability on poor performance, false promise of salary reviews, ... , most recently removal of employee benefits. Discrimination towards language teams Very difficult progression specially if you arent English Management lies and unqualified Salary is basic and salary reviews very little They hire teens with no work experience or work ethics Redundancies are often. Treated like a school kid by higher ups. Poor organisation. Poor Communication. Un-motivating place to work. Alot of changes going back and forth.. - Pay could be slightly higher - Hard to develop and progress as employment is slowing down. Lack of leadership on teams from more junior manager roles, more corporate than before Workload. The line manager was always on holiday despite knowing I was just a starter.  Lack of training given. Make it as hard as possible for employees to progress and hire externally when they have plenty of capable staff already in their employ. pay could be more, could have more recognition for hard work. To stressed, ridiculous targets , and team leaders are bullies. Procedures are always changing and contradicting. The company wants blood out of you. The company is very dodgy and tries to cover its tracks very strategically. Racism still exists in this company if I could rate no stars I would.. Space for growth for your career feels limited. Nothing other than workload can get a bit heavy at times, would enjoy a better work life balance. - Poor internal communications - Asos is a place where management are terrible at cascading information that you need to know down the hierarchy. This could  be staff moves , supplier /relations. This will make you feel not important. - Poor systems - well at least in my role, you will have to do everything on massive excel sheets which are on the verge of crashing your computer down any moment. Asos needs some investment in retail systems - regular emerging last minute deadlines that could easily be planned into the critical path - emails are frequently sent with deadlines due in shorter time than it takes on average to complete the task causing a frenzy which breaks down the document that needs to be filled in - poor attitude to mental health - management haven't been trained adequately on dealing with employees whose mental health is worsening and the risk it poses to Asos.  For example when a manager was told that someone on their team is suffering from poor mental health because of things going on Asos they privately berated them for not having what it takes to work at the company and excluded them for being up for any promotional opportunities.. An extremely hierarchical company with thousands of employees, can feel like you are just a cog in the ever expanding ASOS machine. There is very much a \"wait your turn\" culture so although there are opportunities to progress, you had better get in line. Senior management certainly talk the talk when it comes to ensuring employee happiness but ultimately day to day I found the culture very cut-throat and certainly experienced elements of bullying.. Slow progression, low pay.. over work and underpaid, little opportunity and benefits continuously stripped. Reduction of perks over the last 2 years (xmas party, friday drinks, free fruit, reduction of staff discount). salary is bad, no clear progression to move up.. Low salary  and expensive food  in canteen. highly unprofessional and would not recommend at all. Heavy workload, sometimes impossible. Internal communication in some areas has completely disappeared leaving employees feeling in the dark, unsupported, wary of leadership. Atmosphere has become secretive and at times hostile. A series of poor decisions has eroded the great culture and atmosphere had been built. Huge turnover and loss of talent. Inconsistency between business areas.. The parties and some of the people. Lots of promises of development and progression that never come to fruition. Inconsistencies  with management methods.  The salary is not competitive.  Put the night staff through redundancy twice in 6 months.  If your face fits, you progress.. Management style sometimes very challenging. No benefits, low opportunity for development, company in crysis. No care about employees  Awful salary  No perks  Crazy hours. Work procedures are not suitable for certain markets.. Company in crisis Salary is not competitive Very limited opportunities for progression. I no longer work there. Change in focus, lack of reporting,. Abhorrent and humiliating HR processes Severe lack of care and understanding for their people Horrendous lack of development opportunities Poor decision making from top level which has cost hundreds of jobs Poor data management and reporting capabilities for a global company. Very strict and controlling on work completed. Extremely fake, gossipy environment, a lot of bullying going on. Buyers get away with anything they want, come in late all the time, talk to you as rude as they like. Its one rule for them, another for you. You could be late a few times in one week and and theyll pull you for a chat. But dont even think about mentioning theyre late nearly every day. Dont complain to anyone above them either, or ask to move teams as youll get fired, they are all close. HR do nothing to help or support you but team up, and make up a scenario with these people to get you fired. They wont even follow the correct disciplinary procedure, even when you have passed probation. I was the most hard working person on my team staying until 8pm most days, but it was never appreciated. When they fire you they will say you stayed late because you came in late, to try and make themselves look better, when you was hardly late at all.   Do not even think about showing an interest in a different area of the business, like they promote to you at interview. They will fire you for not having passion for your role. I tried to network and ask current employees how to get experience for the role and was told that was wrong, even when the replies were helpful. I asked the interviewer for advice on how to get experience after not getting a role and I was repeatedly ignored when all I showed was extreme passion. This will also get you fired because they will complain it made them feel uncomfortable. They wont just reply to you like a normal human being would, and put you at ease, thats clearly too much for them to do as a manager.  When youre getting dismissed they will list extremely pathetic reasons to make it look more legitimate. Even things that happened before you were at ASOS, because their source on information doesnt know all the facts. Never trust anyone, when they want you gone, they will use everything against you. I dont know how ASOS get away with treating employees the way they do. Dont even think about telling HR or your head that your job is affecting your mental health, you will also get fired within days, when they make up an excuse as to why. ASOS make out they care about mental health awareness, they are liars.   You are overworked here, and stressed out, it can take 2+ years to progress to a more senior position as everyone is very clicky. People above you will give you work way above your level because theyre too lazy to do it themselves but say it is for your progression. A lot of employees in buying do not last, as no one genuinely cares about you. Take my advice and DO NOT WORK HERE.. Management is lacking and lack of respect for the employees. Customers can only contact via online. Each time customers get in touch it will be with a new adviser even if the case is ongoing.. High degree of favoritism within a team, excessive office politics between teams, and HR has zero confidentiality  Employees are often on PIP with little time to demonstrate improvement before they are terminated. Promised progression and promotion that never happened Poor communication  Struggles to make simple decisions  Poor salary  Benefits being cut School like environment  Terrible hours with very early starts and late finishes including weekends and bank holidays. a lot of tasks need to be done. Shifts are different each week, targets to hit or you are out, watch your every move. No room to progress. A lot of redundancy issues.. Pay rate, growth in career. Shifts were different every week. Not given enough support and are technical. Progression slower than some companies I have worked for previously as you get higher up in level.. bad pay, badly organised/ managed and they timed toilet breaks. Awful management No communication Treat employees awfully Hardly any progression No work/life balance due to shift patter s. Made employees redundant as a group via casual conversation!. Difficult to progress and get promoted due to limited head count. Hard to progress, mixed salaries for same role. Due to rapid growth the office was under constant change.. Can be difficult to progress.. Terrible management, lack of training for new starters, no concern for health or mental health. Terrble handling of Covid. Extremely negative place to work in, feels like highschool. The company has grown rapidly over the last 10 years and some key systems have struggled to grow in tandem. These include development, recognition and overall engagement from staff. There is also a huge disconnect between senior management and staff, especially within CC.. Overworked, extremely competitive promotions, when put forward for promtions over 100 people go for an interview process with only one position available which is extremely hard to prep for as well as doing your day job. To get signed off you need to tick off certain tasks whihc are hard to when there is not enough staff and the role is so admin heavy. Busy environment, centre of London so expensive to travel. Upper management wasnt that great and didnt listen to employees. shifts were long and weirdly spaced ,one minute on earlies then lates. Underpaid and overworked staff in my position. Challenges with some senior management, and a bit of a blame culture, which makes it difficult for individuals to thrive. Culture of long working hours, little support for flexible working within retail. -Management treat you like a slave -Team managers are entitled to talk bad to you and treat you bad -They follow you when you go to the bathroom -Management time you when you go to the bathroom -Barista talk bad to everybody. Redundancies constantly, so not a reliable role Lack of communication. No sales bonus for staffs. Financial issues, risks of redundancy.. Their employees are the least important thing to them. In the past year myself and my colleagues have been through Several round of redundancy and not once offered any kind of support or an understanding ear from upper management. The ASOSers make this company who they are and to see them treated so poorly pushed me to leave. In my own person experience, I witnessed team leaders and advisors pushed to their breaking points with no support what so ever from those direct reports. Managers dont get to know the advisors in their operations or how they are working.. Some politics across the company between departments. - Management were awful. My manager was rude, aggressive, had no idea how to manage, would actively single people out, made my life miserable the whole time I was there, mentally attacked people and their personalities - just awful. She was a BULLY, no other word for it.  - HR did nothing for their employees despite numerous complaints about these bullies - The role was completely not what it was supposed to be, I spent most of the time reconciling invoices because the company is massively in debt to their brands - Brands were cutting them off because they owed them millions of pounds, quite surprised how they stay afloat!  - Very cliquey, and not very culturally diverse. You either have to be white or act white to fit in here. - Have clothes sales for staff but most sizes were below size 6 for females, makes sense and most of the girls there do look anorexic - General bad vibe, no one I met was actually happy there but stayed because of the company. No future No opportunity  Made us redundant to employ people in Philippines. Not so much a con but this is a fast-paced company so priorities can change quickly.. nights some workers seem to know how to cheat the system. Like a robot Xpo staff are superior. Inexperienced leadership and awful shift rotation. My manager wasn't a people person. Not good management, benefits were all taken away and pay was decreased. Stretched very thin, expected to step into full time roles with minimal training.. The lack of genuine progression due to being a high performer, a culture of favouritism and praise based on friendships- if you are here to be recognised for hard work and being a good person then you have come to the wrong place - this claims to value this but it couldnt be further from the truth. No cons that I can think of except for the size of the company and industry restructures are common. Robotic, constantly being watched. Everything is tracked. Very repetitive work, management sat around doing nothing getting paid over twice your salary which isn't particularly motivating. You need to be liked for the person you are to get promotion, easy for some but frustrating for others. Clone Culture, no diversity.  Toxic HR. School like environment, not much support from management. Organisational structure is confused but is likely to change. Overloaded with work and there is a lack of professionalism at times with no clear company guidelines. poor senior management and the CEO has shown his diversity, equality and inclusion is all a smoke and mirrors act. He has repeatedly shown he doesn't care about his staff unless they're high up or stakeholders. Office is like a school playground and if you're not willing to brown nose or fall in line, you will be managed out. Red tape, complex org structure and too many middle managers. Management in cliques prevent progression.. It's a young company which you grow out of and move on.. People keeps progressing just by being there instead of recruiting actual professional for certain roles. Admin Heavy, takes long time to progress. It's a safe place to work but not very much appreciated. they fib a bit about the future. Low salaries, over worked and very busy. Hard to progress, long hours. Bad terms, bad managerial attitude. Can seem lonely, as you work independently. Stressful and very hectic at times. slow progression, feels like you are not valued. The assistants earn 18-22k and this is not enough to live in London, especially when you have to get in for 6.45-7am on Mondays and rarely get out of work before 7pm. There is a culture of over-working and if you try to go home on time there can be comments (I should mention there is a clever clause in your contract that states that you might have to work overtime for free!). Also its very high stress for the pay you get and as much as some people are lovely, some are awful and on more than one occasion I've heard people crying in the toilets.. Salary, diversity, progression, work life balance. Little room for progression, redundancy, higher up decisions made for the business and not staff. Shift based job no work-life balance  Redundancy process not ethical.  Many cost cuts that effect employees. Unrealistic understandings in TA function and the differences between tech hiring and finance, vs fashion. Not a one size fits all. really bad experience with management, someone under qualified was promoted to a team leader role and this subsequently forced most of the team members to hand in their notice due to the poor leadership and lack of care for other employees. the person in question who was promoted was the only male person within a team of about 8 and also was close friends from school with one the head of post production, who then interviewed him for the team leader role. they didn't seem to care when everyone started handing in their notice and felt deflated and demotivated to work since one of the worst members of the team was promoted .. Management have their favourite choices of photographers Freelance job days are not first come first serve but whoever they see fit  Poor communication  Will drop you without any explanation. why do I have to do this. management felt distant and cliquey i don't want to be part of the fast fashion business model that based on news and research is causing a lot of issues for the poor around the world and our planet. Too many manual processes, low salary for the amount of work, work role status is in limbo after CC redundancies. Too much bureaucracy involved meant slow paced work. perks were good at first but were stripped back, unequal pay, poor manager (as direct reports, we had more experience and knowledge than the person we reported into). Fast paced and big company, hard to stand out. Outsourcing to other countries CC is not based in UK anymore. A lot of empty promises in the end as a lot of us were made redundant (not due to COVID). Hard to progress, very limited opportunities. Slow progression within the roles. Unprofessional Company culture  Company values training programs community involvement. customers can be abuse sometimes. Customer Care now minimal and outsourced. micro management, very little opportunity for progression.. No cons, great company to join. There was a bully mentality, progression was not an option in the HR department unless you conformed. Opinions or hard work was not valued or recognised. In turn led to a lack of support or care for HR employees mental health mainly caused by a toxic work environment.. No progression, poor management, redundancy. Bus times are not great from Barnsley asos. Fast pace and always lots to do!. Continuous redundancy in the company, workload is high, slow progression and bad pay rise. Reduce workload and hire more people!. Lack of care for employees. Rubbish management You're treated like a child Never an available manager when you need one Managers don't seem to understand the job of standard advisors. Lack of work life balance and flexibility. So many levels promotions are slow. Fast paced with heavy workload. Some benefits being taken away. Micro management, no progression, redundancies. Senior management not very professional and ceo all about himself. micro management, redundancies, no room for progression. - Micro managing QA leads - Projects didn't have direction and were running over budget - Business didn't have much confidence in the tech team. GLC is still running, and it's clepotocracy, management make their own promo codes and senior management rob the company. Old CCM signed a nda after paying his own private company hundreds of thousands. The company is messed up to it's core The watford office smelt of drugs and GLC you find powder in the toliets. This is all acutally true. You could make a movie from ASOS. DO NO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. Salary isnt the greatest for the level of work done. Low hourly rate, unsociable hours. Quick to ideation, slower to deliver. Has become corporate as it has grown up over the last decade. Democracy is a plus and drawback as there can be a lot of meetings and little achieved.   If this were a smaller company I don't think it could sustain the meetings and design by committee approach. This has gotten worse in the last decade.  Recent restructure is, in the short term at least, very inefficient and came just before the most demanding part of the financial year (Black Friday Weekend). Bottle neck for progression Becoming more corporate losing core values. Poor progression Low salary progression Extremely competitive. Big walks you know man. extreme levels of workload with little relief. A lot of constant change. Feels like very slow progression. Salary does not show that they put the workers first.. Accept any roles in London headquarters only. nothing wrong, I can't think of anything. Can be long hours but this is expected. Over worked and under paid.. Pay is not a lot for my self personally.. Progression is not quick at this business. There is no possibility to grow internally. You wont understand a thing thats management is doing. Low pay and slow career progression. Below industry standard for pay. The only other issue I have is how management speak to the rest of asos. See below.. Haven't experienced any in my time there. Lacks structure due to fast-paced nature. Fast paced well established environment. Long hours poor time management and slow progression. Much more needed around flexibility - so behind the times. The Customer Care Graduate Scheme did not guarantee a job upon completion. The majority of grads ended up leaving as a result. - benefits slowly diminishing - no bonus in all my years there  - discount reduced - lack of progression/ development  - lack of movement within company. There is ZERO accountability for line managers Not encouraged to move sideways into different departments Transformation programs very messy. No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,. hectic and poor communication with little career development. Increasingly corporate Lack of diversity throughout and within board Made to come into the office throughout COVID So much work and not much appreciation. Culture, poor management, underlying internal politics, poor recruitment, poor policies. A lot of benefits have gone. Our team has lost two thirds of the people but there's the same amount of work or more. No time to focus on personal growth or anything else because there's so much work. Design leadership also gone so there's no direction or inspiration any more.. Expensive to get to each day. You need to be the management favourite. Poor management Salaries Low opportunities Strict processes Too far away from the train station. Autocratic, very bad culture/behaviours, misogynistic boys club, wild. Management / top level / pay. very cliquey, lots of micro-managing. Secondary school environment, slow progression you have tiers in the job roles eg MA has 3 levels to pass to become an AM could take up to 6 years to progress to the level above. Pay is shocking youll get better pay in a supermarket, no disrespect. It isnt what you think it will be I wish I listened to the reviews before I started. Expected to work long hours without recognition. Treated like a child. - very poor work life balance, WFH not a thing - progression is tough and there's a very much a favouritism culture - lots of unnecessary admin. None, that I would like to comment. Not enough hours a week. discount cut redundancies no more staff appreciation days no job security. very strict timings on breaks- micromanaged. - No work life balance - All benefits have slowly been reduced.. Slow progression Slow integration of new systems. Not as many opportunities for personal development. Where do I begin. Everything was wrong from the start. They were not geared up to welcome new starters and I waited 8 weeks for the systems access in order to do my job properly. I then waited a further 4 weeks for my line manager to hand over jobs to me because they are the worst micro managers and dont know how to delegate or manage their time. On top of that the blame culture within ASOS is the worst I have ever experienced, no one is accountable for anything with a lot of people looking to hide mistakes, blame someone else and talk down to you. I have spent the last 5 months being gaslighted by my boss who is incompetent and thrives off making people feel bad about themselves. The systems at ASOS are not fit for purpose and you spend 80% of your time waiting for reports to run/information to come back and even then you have to run 3 reports because the reporting system cant handle the amount of lines youre reporting on. The whole set up is a waste of peoples time and skills. I am fortunate enough to have never suffered from my mental health prior to working here but the way I have been treated at ASOS means I have suffered from the worst anxiety and panic attacks ever. There hasnt been a day I havent cried or been treated poorly and the job isnt worth it, the workload and the pay is the worst. Dont put yourself through it. They email on sundays and at 9pm + and it is not conducive to good work life balance or a happy lifeX. Sometimes can feel a little hectic, so not everyones cup of tea. However if you can handle it, youll thrive at ASOS.. toxic culture, boys club, lack of progression. the only cons no many Career Opportunities. Low salary in comparison to competitors. Have to think about it. Progression based on who you know rather than skills or experience All employees are disposable. Office politics and high turnover. There are no cons from working at asos. progression was slow and managers made it clear the level difference. Long and expensive commute from London. Big company so can get lost amongst other employees. Long hours, weekends, not enough event parties,. Weekends work management not great either. No bank holiday extras. Gone into administration. (Glassdoor would not let me select this option). the working environment could be more diverse. Very patriarchal and unrepresentative at the top.. I never openly talked about my religion but I am muslim with a black girlfriend. The culture in the ML team around ethnic minorities and muslims is disgusting. A very undiverse almost like an Oxford version of Google rejects.  Long hours with weekend working  no progression unless you know how to stroke egos  The team don't understand experimental research methods or machine learning outside of neural networks  extreme bias against working class, BAME, and muslims.  Product owners don't know much about product ownership or management. Expect you to do a job three times your salary and wont progress you. Progression is dependant entirely on your personal relationship with your team leader regardless of your personal qualities.. Dont reflect that in salary. night shift were quite long. Hours too long and different. VERY SLOW progression and not enough time to do all tasks. Always too cold, shifts, management. lack of career progression, management go on holiday when you're a new starter leaving you to manage a department on your own, you work long hours with no appreciation. long hours, and difficult technology. very little/ barely any room for growth  admin heavy   no pay for overtime. lack of support & work over time. no cons loved ever minute of it. No cons for me was a very good experience. Some organisational complexity in achieving clear outcomes. Accountability was often unclear. Technology & Product often worked against, instead of with each other. Unclear team & departmental level objectives.. Can't think of any cons. - toxic environment dominated by politics in the management layer - big egoes in the management layer - HR taking the side of the more powerful rather than acting as an impartial  - completely lack of transparency - company values are true only on paper. No or slow progression, low salary compared to some other companies. Lost it's niche! Getting too corporate.. None that you don't get in any job. Can get a bit hectic as there are so many people in one building. over worked, underpaid, very very slow progression lack of care in a pandemic stressful environment, blame culture, low morale in teams. Fast growing company that cant keep up with growth spurt. just a number, clicky, dead end job. Can be repetitive Atmosphere usually stressed. Not a huge room for progression unless people leave. Management deem you as difficult if you question there decisions. High volume and high pressured environment. Leadership could be a bit more transparent. Long hours, work life balance, blame culture. Micromanaging all over the place. Long hours, slow progression, work weekends  management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising. Management is very poor, doing everything by the book. You are always being watched, being told off even if you spend one minute extra on your toilet break. No room for promotion.. Bias agency  Hard work especially stock control Be aware of the women with ginger hair in pod 3 : NIGHTMARE. Salary ratio to Hours worked. lots of extra unpaid hours worked, hierarchy and treatment off management. I didn't get paid for my overtimes. Progression - there are 3 stages per role. 0 transparency toward the staff. Bad management  Un appreciative of staff. High likelihood of last minute team and department changes. Lack of females within the senior leadership teams.. Decision making is often questionable and you can feel frustrated.. too much work, too much fatigue, target very heavy to achieve. Communications need some improvement, lack of diversity in exec board & leadership. the workload is very heavy - expect to work a lot more than contracted hours. only black guy in the team. Not enough comms from management, cliquey, not enough diversity.. - VERY hard to be promoted, needs to be the right timing, things change a lot. - depending on you're line manger, some people shouldn't be mangers.. Very fast paced and sometimes direction can change quickly. Treated like youre at school. - lack of communication - no clear company policy/entitlement rights. Salaries have slipped way below market. 1. No more good parties. Very top down communication. No incentive or encouragement to pursue passion projects/change. Little emphasis on sustainability. Pay is okay but no room for negotiation.. lack of progression low Pay. Low salary for London life. Its a typical big corporation in many ways- high turnover of staff and the training you receive upon starting is terrible.. Can be a tough Environment to work in with high expectations and long hours. Department lacked vision and leadership was lackluster. Outsourcing to poor external company caused more problems than it solved. Benefits increasingly reduced. Hamstrung by poor policies e.g. we would be punished if we attempted to refund a delivery charge (for a late delivery or in the case that an order wasn't delivered) unless the customer actively asked us to.. management , wage , hours , facilities. Progression within department is next to impossible. long work hours, normal pay. * Management are often quite late in sharing organisational changes * For the work that LSEs do, they deserve a little more compensation. Some Company benefits depend on department. Pair programming disaster, chaos environment, noise in the office, low salaries, no bonus, siloses of knowledge, architects living in their own world. Low salary compared to other businesses. Clear favouritism within the organisation and salary did not quite match with the workload. Working on womenswear - not such a good vibe Some people have big egos Teams work differently within a department. Very little progression, base salary is very low. Kids managing kids, poor leadership, more invested in making the work place look nice than how they treated staff. My impression of this company is that it is full of jerks. They're above average in the narcissism department, but I don't think that explains it entirely. I read in another review about islamophobia. I was also shocked by attitudes towards muslims during my very brief time at ASOS. Attitudes from some quite well paid people. I complained about it to HR. They told me I was lying. When I proved I wasn't they said they didn't care. It felt at times like working for an organised crime ring. I've worked for a lot of companies. I found this place horrid. And depressing. I don't think I've ever found going into work so depressing in my life.. Nepotism C suite arrogance Lack of innovation. Where do I even begin with this? We were overworked and underpaid, expected to work long hours (particularly on Monday when the systems would crash as you tried to do anything). If you left on time youd be on the receiving end of tuts and snarky comments.  There was absolutely no chance for progression. I made it clear during my interview that was what I was looking for in this job and was promised the world but what I found instead was tasks being dropped on you from a higher level under the guise of progression, only to receive no assistance and when you (inevitably) fail youd be blasted in front of the whole team. Youd also be expected to cover colleagues work when on holiday which on its own is not a unfair request but on multiple occasions I had to pick up a colleagues task they had left for days only to be told off and when I couldnt cover my workload, their workload, helping to train a new person and the task theyd just left prior to their holiday - somehow myself not being able to cover this was my issue and not the issue of the person on holiday.  This brings us to the biggest issue I found at ASOS the workplace bullying. I loathe to call someone this but my manager was nothing more than a bully protected by the managers above them. Once they had decided they had it out for me my time was done and I was bullied to the point of a mental breakdown, and pulled into a meeting where I felt I had no choice to quit or be fired. In a last ditch attempt I went to HR only to have them feed back to my bullys manager who in turn pulled me to one side and brought up the comments I had made. So much for confidentially. In the end I felt like I had to rescind my comments in my exit interview for fear of my reference being in danger.   Never been so happy to leave a job in my life.. nothing bad to say about it really. On your feet all shift. Poor management who are completely detached from the processes involved in entry level roles, lack of support for new employees, difficult to progress (very rigid promotion structure where you have to be in specific roles for a certain amount of time before being 'allowed' to be put forward for promotions), don't often have enough time in the day to make use of any of the perks, lots of staff are extremely unhappy and the retention rate within teams is low.. management , building , lowering the discount , making people redundant. People with a bit of power are arrogant, from other deparments as well, there are no team work at all and no chances to progress if you're a foreigner.. no personal life, extremely stressful, limited work life balance. Senior leadership rolling back benefits, terrible pay (despite increased profits) & many senior team managers have no people leadership skills. Favouriting managers, poor level of management. Progression  salary increases Diversity needs to improve. Toxic, No room for progression, treated as a number, not respected, undervalued, overworked, cliche fashion environment   \n",

       "      <td>Friendly, helpful and hard-working colleagues. Easy to get the job even without experience in finance. Easy to get the job, Nice colleagues.. Good investment management strategy. Overall there are individual admin staff that are very nice and helpful. Free parking . Meet some nice people in the teams . Flexible hours . Benefits sickness death in service bonus if you employed for over 1 year .. I find AFH to be a caring employer, that is both adaptable to  employees' needs and prepared to listen to opinions.   Since I've worked at AFH there have been many progressive changes for the workforce in the way of employee benefits (for example, these include a savings scheme, discounted gym membership, annual company events and after-hours classes such as French and Pilates).   The office itself is a great working environment, with a friendly and open staff who make newcomers welcome.   There is ample free &amp; secure staff parking available and the train/bus route is convenient. Staff inductions are always carried out and training needs are regularly monitored.   Progression through the company is encouraged and it's possible to change career paths internally if opportunities arise.. AFH is a great company to work for. The training courses available are brilliant, from Excel training to product knowledge, all courses are available to all staff. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming. The CEO always acknowledges you when he sees you, as do all management. We have annual staff events (summer events and christmas parties) which are a great way to mingle with staff from other levels of the office. There are a number of other pros for working for AFH such as: - discount at local gyms - Saving Schemes - family fun day bbqs - great atmosphere working the office - annual bonus - secure parking - payrise based on performance.. ...The list could go on!!  Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company.  We have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.  All in all I really enjoy working for AFH!. Big group of young people. There are opportunities to advance and progress in different directions. A great place to work with a really caring and great employer. Nothing! The whole package was completely  mis-sold. All sounded too good to be true and it was.. hours ok colleagues and line managers are really nice. Friendly people, almost like a family!. I joined AFH in December 2017 and have found them to be a truly great company to work for. On week one meetings were arranged for me with all the Senior Managers from the various departments so I could understand the different parts of the business.  There is a good positive atmosphere at AFH and you are actively encouraged to talk openly about any issues including with the CEO. The benefits package is good but just as important, you are made to feel valued and recognised for a job well done. I work with many teams across AFH and find them to be helpful and generous with their time.  Good work / life balance is also very much in evidence.. I jumped from a bankassurance world into the world of IFA and was very careful about selecting AFH as I interviewed with plenty of companies before choosing this one.  Everything they told me about themselves was true, as I found out later, and they put their money where their mouth is when they say they put clients first, which is incredibly refreshing after working for banks who say one thing and do another.  Everyone is happy to help and support you where they can, and I am left to do my own thing successfully and build my own business without micromanagement, which for me is crucial!   AFH look after their staff well,  and it's a pleasure to work for a company who you feel are working in the right way for their staff, themselves and their clients.. AFH really does pride itself on looking after it's clients and this is evident in the way it supports staff to progress with qualifications. Individuals who work for AFH get the opportunity to develop and progress if they put the work in.  Lovely office and very friendly staff.. The multiple Xmas &amp; Summer events which the CEO's PAs spend their whole time organising.. Approachable staff Client focused Staff Benefits are increasing Great way to get your foot in the door Progression and movement is encouraged. A growing and profitable company. Flexible hours, compressed hours and part time working are all potentially available. Ability to buy and sell holidays. Reasonably diverse mix of employees at lower levels. Reasonable office facilities and friendly staff.. Working hours  Some of the people you work with My actual boss (not supervisor) was supportive and did try to make me feel more comfortable.. Great people in some places, excellent Christmas/Summer parties. Majority of the people there are lovely, and thats about the only pro. Nice environment, love people, not too stressful. -Great People -Heading in a good direction generally. Friendly, engaged, all staff members can be close to CEO with a 'family' environment. Friendly coworkers. Ready to help at any moment. Feels like a family.. Horrible experience working here. Would not recommend.. None, they lie about working hours, bonuses, projects and pay. There are none to speak of. Good company to work for</td>\n",
       "      <td>AFH is a caring employer known for friendly colleagues and a supportive, family-like environment. Employees appreciate the focus on work-life balance, opportunities for training and career progression, and increasing benefits like savings schemes and company events. The company is also praised for open communication and listening to employee feedback.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Poor salary which doesn't improve much with progression, no incentive to work harder, high turnover of staff, poor systems. Very low salary, poor working conditions, very little training provided but high expectations. Micro management are young, inexperienced and superficial girls who are not able to provide guidance and support for their teams.. Abysmal pay, around minimum wage. No actual training for your job role. No incentive to improve. training. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth when the CEO drives a roll royce and the majority of the workers are payed so lowly. The management and seniors are ruthless. No training for staff. Staff are poorly paid and virtually no retention. The consultants have no communication and despite being a \"national\" firm they can't seem to understand anything beyond Bromsgrove.. Not treated at all well after 6 yrs of being a loyal hard working member of staff . This company just pushes you out and replaces you with someone who they think is right or someone who just agrees !  It's called constructive dismissal , note to self should of took this to court !   Not sure who owns the company as the CEO seems to let the operations manager run the place ! Which nobody has respects for !   HR do not trust at all they there to help employees but all they do is protect the company !   To much work , stressful , salary low , lack of experienced staff in admin !   I would not recommend AFH to anyone Employee of choice they call it funny it's definitely not !. I am unable to find any Cons for AFH Wealth Management.  This is a great company to work for.. I cannot think of any cons for working for AFH.. Abysmal pay. Try to get away with paying staff bare minimum. Really high staff turnover.. Sometimes you have to wash up your own cup !!. Lack of support to develop. The HR team is a shambles.. i worked at their AFH Insure division, give you leads that are impossible to work.  Training pretty much none existent. Desk managers cant help as they are expected to generate their own sales and struggle to help their team to improve the overall desk revenue.  Cold calling the same people over and over again even when told not to ring back.  I spent last week ring people over 70 if they want life insurance,  or reviewing old policies.  Cancel your current policy and then take out one with less cover for more money.. Progression is hard, almost feels like the supervisors/managers dont want progression sometimes.   Pay is too low. No cons to speak of. Nothing worth mentioning at all.. None I can think of.. Too many to list unfortunately. IMO and based on my experiences there: Unless this is your first job where you get some workplace experience, don't apply.  Extremely unethical practices Senior Leadership Team are mostly internally promoted therefore leave very little to be desired in terms of how to actually run a business. Toxic culture SLT like to talk about innovation or change but have no idea how to implement or probably even want to HR team are also incompetent and I personally was privy to numerous unethical practices when recruiting.. Salary for administration staff needs to be looked into. (Extra 2-4k a year to match other companies will improve statistics). Autocratic, very much a my way or the highway organisation. Quality control an issue, with an emphasis on volume rather than quality. Largely ineffective middle management. Training and upskilling are low priorities. Some job insecurity, the company can be quite ruthless when managing out people.. Supervisor made me very uneasy from the start never introduced me to the rest of the team, not a people person and wasnt approachable. was not supportive and expects you to know exactly what youre doing even if you have never been in that sector before.. Poor pay, huge gap for pay between senior management vs those who support them, managers who bully yet you are the one driven away, lack of flexibility. Salaries are much lower than market competitors and there is no standard salary ladder, they just pay each individual person whatever they can get away with. Most of management is shocking and know nothing about how the company/processes work - or how to manage a team, young girls just go for the promotion for the higher pay but are not capable of doing any management role There is no progression at all. Management can be clicky at times. -Low Salary -Middle Management likes to micro Manage  -Staff Retention in Investment Admin team very low. Views itself as a boutique, not able to break out of a mould. IT accessories are old and cheap - monitors, mouse, etc.. Awful management  Micro management Only care about numbers and money not the happiness of their staff Happy to go against government guidelines and risk the health and safety of staff members to prematurely make staff go into the office even though people were t pleased with it- when I told them I was unhappy with the 6 days notice they terminated my contract with immediate effect for this reason  They dont care about their staff at all and if you raise an concerns or voice your own opinion they will get rid of you with no valid reason and will not follow any procedure.. -Unachievable bonus unfairly set by manager -bullying -MICROMANAGEMENT  -long hours  -no sympathy to people who travel or have children  -Manager is extremely rude and condescending -High staff turnover  -Mistreatment of staff -False promises -Lied to about job role-it was cold calling  -If you challenge management you are fired without warning or proper procedures -Do not follow covid guidelines -Poor response from hr and manager as a whole  -Insufficient workload but then have the cheek to ask you what you're doing. Borderline bullying, nepotism, overworked - steer clear. Communication between departments is lacking</td>\n",

       "      <td>The operations staff are generally good people and hard workers. Next door to a pub... Trust me, you'll consider it to be a pro after a couple of weeks working here. Not much else.. The core staff, managers and above, have been there for 10 years or more. It means there is a stable environment to work in.

I am currently studying towards the ACCA qualification and AJ Bell offer full study support with paid study leave. - Rotations within the Finance department have meant that I have gained exposure to many of the key areas such as purchase ledger, sales ledger, cashbook and stat accounts. - Great team atmosphere!. Very friendly office. Good management structure and lots of opportunities for progression.. Varied workforce, from graduates to more experienced members of staff, all friendly. Good social aspect, easy to get involved. Study support is very good when utilised. The company are often flexible to individual needs and management are down to earth and easy to get on with..

Fantastic Christmas party, payday drinks each month, paid volunteering opportunities (organised through work).  Modern &amp; bright office.  Amazing L&amp;D opportunities and paid learning for work.  Monthly leadership breakfasts with directors/heads of departments, free breakfast.  Staff are kept updated with business progression, amazing atmosphere when we launched our IPO in December 2018..

Good working environment Mostly friendly staff Stable and secure job Team atmosphere &amp; good Christmas/summer party On-site small gym. Great pensions training but no progression.. Great offices and benefits on offer. Great Learning &amp; Development Team and qualifications offered from apprenticeships to professional qualifications. Good opportunity for progression, like many employers hard work is rewarded in the long run. Has handled the COVID situation remarkably well considering WFH was never an option for anyone below management previously as it was not believed it would be possible across the board, they have proven themselves wrong and adapted very quickly offering a lot of support and have not been afraid to provide the resource required to make it possible.. - Some ok people to work with in the team - the gym is useful onsite, if you're allowed time to use it. Great working atmosphere, lots of chance for progression. Great office and working environment, good on-site facilities, gym, roof terrace and large communal area. Well organised and well attended company events, Financial support for relevant professional qualifications.. I've been working at AJ Bell for over 15 years and during that time have worked in 5 different roles, progressing each time to the role I am in now. The business is at a scale now which means there is genuine opportunity to not only progress but also to diversify in terms of the direction of your career and also your skills.  There is a real family feel here and I feel genuinely valued as an employee. Having a young family myself and a full time job can be tricky to manage, but AJ Bell have been nothing but supportive to incorporate flexibility where possible. The on-site gym, pay day drinks and numerous opportunities to socialise with team mates are a real bonus to an already great business.. Great culture within the business towards staff and customers - really refreshing to work at a place like this.  Supportive - Management within my area have been amazing in support given for training, progression, workload and even personal life. They really care about you and not just hitting targets.  Successful - whilst no job is 100% stable because of how good the company is I feel a greater level of security than I have elsewhere. The company is profitable, expanding and has even got through the COVID 19 pandemic without furloughing staff and impacting customers (in fact they have provided charitable funds and goods to those that need it most).. Friendly staff, Good Progression, Extra Qualifications, Fast Paced, Amazing Managers. Progression professional qualifications amazing company and on the job training  well looked after from day 1 amazing culture  family feel within the Departments amazing office facilities  the customers at the heart of everything we do.

Personal development is a large factor of daily life, the dedicated learning and development team provide a range of in-house training courses. There is also encouragement for professional qualifications to be completed by employees, in every area of the business which further opens doors for career development.   A strong sense of togetherness is seen across the business through a blend of social events and also numerous areas for social interaction within the office.. Great office space, friendly staff, great opportunities for progression!!. If you like working for a company that is sexist, where senior management dont care for staff and point the finger and blame others, then this is the company for you. If you want to progress, you either have to sleep with a senior manager, director or be married to them. If you want to complain, this wont be heard as cover ups as are frequent and dont they dont take it seriously. They have a conflict of interest as senior managers are married to directors, so they are all in a click. Nice building and metro link is on the doorstep.. Fast paced, great opportunities for progression, senior management and leaders are involved at all levels, company benefits are brilliant (e.g. free gym, holidays etc.). Nice office grounds (Mcr) Everyone's friendly Inclusivity Onsite gym Great transport links. Sociable work place, good progression.. Good work culture, adaptive and professional. Nice people to work with. - Fair management  -Good annual pay rises -Good progression. Endless amounts of training on AJ Bell products and staff discount on Youinvest services allowed me to consolidate many old workplace pensions and get a better deal.. A good place to work. There is opportunity to progress. good company to work for, nice office.. AJ Bell is an excellent company with a good pay scale and plenty of incentives.. If you're happy to accept an average salary and poor benefits to get your foot in the door of the Financial Services industry then AJ Bell is the place for you. The low bar for staff entry means you can get your first experience in Financial Services before moving on to a company that actually protects and values its staff. My advice to anyone looking to work at AJ Bell is to use it as a stepping stone in your career. Get the experience, and the name on your CV, then get out.. Nice offices and some nice people work there. Great people and culture, loads of opportunity for progression and development. Very supportive when serious illness affects you.. Great momentum after the company floated. One of the best employers in UK. Great employee benefits Good working atmosphere Flexible working. Lots of internal job openings once you understand the business and the products. No furlough during lockdown, secure industry Nice offices, on-site gym and payday drinks Friendly staff More flexible now, regular work from home Lots of training courses available and development programs. everyone is in the same boat so coworkers are easy to get along with. AJ Bell is one of the best organisations I have worked for. Its inclusive, friendly and very secure. Having moved from a more sales based organisation it is a breath of fresh air to not be KPI driven and particularly right now, to know that I am working in an very stable industry. I have been promoted since being here, put through formal qualifications and feel like a valued member of the AJ Bell team. The potential to work from home more in a post covid world is a big benefit for me. I'm excited for the future of my career.. Pay day drinks, Christmas/Summer party, virtual events during lockdown.. Company drinks, good Christmas / Summer do, nice people. Good work / life balance when volumes are lower.. Near to home, great people. Study package, friendly working environment.. Friendly team who are helpful and approachable. Good manager who will spare me time even when theyre really busy.   Good that you can take professional qualifications paid for by the company.  Some of the reviews on Glassdoor about AJ bell just do not reflect my experience of working here - Ive had good support from my manager and the HR team when Ive needed it.  I think AJ Bell has done a good job of looking after its staff during Covid.. Good social events and Christmas parties.. Good social events before Covid. Decent bonuses/ payrises.. Other colleagues and the odd manager. Colleagues are really friendly, social environment Lots of support from management and our CEO during the COVID situation, felt really comfortable and secure in my job Good benefits, such as decent holiday allowance, mental health support, pay day drinks and social/charity events Great office space, inc gym, dining area and roof terrace. Monthly payday drinks (on the last Friday of the month which isn't always payday) Summer &amp; Winter parties Bi-Annual bonus scheme On site gym  From a social perspective, it is brilliant. Supportive environment - manager/team leader always around to help, listen to concerns and promoting development. Good social benefits - I've attended lots of social events throughout my time here &amp; even through COVID we've held virtual cocktail classes &amp; cooking sessions. Job security Nice modern office &amp; great facilities Bi-annual bonuses Holidays are good &amp; we have the option to buy or sell which helps with flexibility throughout the year. Alot of change, fast paced, friendly people, very busy, lots of growth!!. Lovely people, caring management, superb office (with gym and rooftop terrace!) and the best parties!. Employee share scheme Lots of social activities Modern office environment Good prospects for entry level jobs Mainly young workforce Growing business &amp; lots of industry awards. Plenty of opportunity for career development. Average company to work for. The people are what makes going to work bearable. Most people are friendly and approachable, even some of the senior managers. There's are a few added extras that are good:  holiday allowance. Now starts at 24 and increases per full company year to a max of 30 I think.   free on-site gym. There isn't loads of equipment but there are classes morning lunch and after work.  (Obviously not open currently)  nice offices that are modern.   some fantastic colleagues that actually become friends.. - Will employ just about anyone - Somewhere to build experience in financial services for 1-2 years - Mostly harmless managers as long as you do your job - Decent social scene if you are young (pre-lockdown anyway) - Office building is ok I guess. The company does so much to ensure staff are engaged and the career opportunities are fantastic. Nice people, good atmosphere, lots of mobility in terms of working in different departments and areas of the business, opportunities to progress if you're willing to take feedback on board.. Learned a lot about AJ Bell products.. Offices are nice and spacious. Great fellow team members, who became a supportive family through the stressful and often downtrodden atmosphere</td>\n",
       "      <td>AJ Bell provides a friendly, supportive, and sociable work environment with excellent career prospects, training opportunities, and a focus on employee development. The company boasts a great culture, modern offices with amenities like gyms, and various social events, promoting a strong sense of community and work-life balance. Employees appreciate the stable and secure atmosphere, with opportunities for progression and professional development encouraged and supported.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Regular issues with the various computer systems, sometimes creates a perfect storm in which next to no work can be achieved. Almost non-existant progression ladder. Experience and hard work generally remains unacknowledged by management. Equally, industry qualifications seem to count for nothing. Low pay compared to similar positions in other companies. Lack of communication between management and the staff.. As managers have been there for 10 years or more, the opportunities to move up are few and far between. Like a lot of companies, directors have their favourites who will move up regardless of experience or talent.. Salary was very basic. I felt that for the pressure and amount of work, the salary elsewhere is much higher and a lot more competitive.. Will only progress if you know the right people. HR department are not worthy of being the \"go to\" for staff members as they are not trusted and underhand/biased promotions. No flexibility with hours. Hire too many \"kids\" so they can pay cheap wages - and therefore no-one gets treated like an adult or trusted. If you're not liked by the right people you're bullied out.. Not very strong work ethics especially on the team I worked, People should take a more positive approach to work and not just \"do the job\". Hard performers are neither recognised nor rewarded, not very good basic pay and enormous amount of workload within an understaffed team that's main focus should be clients.. Underpaid therefore experienced staff leave making the role harder to do. The company  should increase wages and give people incentives to stay.. Managers just give mates a job, absolutely no prospects and they will regret letting all the experienced staff leave because they are doing. Management are detached  Monotonous Ambition is frowned upon Progression impossible. Poor salary. Support to progress is non existent. There is a huge 'Face fits' culture. Poor operating systems. Training is lacking.. Parking can be an issue and there could be more social engagements available.. Very poor management and lack basic understanding of diversity.. Communication in certain situations &amp; could have higher pension contribution from the company.. Parking is an issue around Tunbridge Wells but there is ample non-resident street parking around the town and some on-site parking available to staff and easy access to rail links.. - Current building is slightly dated however we are moving to a brand new location early this year which has great new facilities including a gym and social areas.. Current office slightly dated, but with a move to a new office space in a few months, nothing to worry about.. Parking is an issue, and the building is outdated however the move to EQ4 early this year will go some way to addressing these.. Current building is very shabby, but we're moving soon. Sometimes it feels like your asked for an opinion on something even though the decision is already made. Can take a while to replace people, suspect down to recruitment policies (see 'pros' list). Pension offering not great in current market. Parking is limited but with the new site move this should hopefully be resolved.. Nature of business doesn't allow true flexible working. Benefits (e.g. pension) package not as competitive as it could be for sector. Very busy, not making full use of all facilities, but this will change as the team develops. They don't give people a fair chance, the basic HR system of aptitude tests doesn't work when it comes to employing new people or promoting those at junior levels. systems need a lot of work. None - only reason I left was they closed the Tunbridge Wells office. Very different cultures between Manchester &amp; London offices, which are not always to the benefit of the company.  The company is so driven to remain at the bleeding edge of the industry, that it ignores what it already has.  Embarrassingly poor benefits package.  Customer service could be better - you get what you pay for.. Lower than average pension contribution.  Low holiday allowance (but increases with service and buy holiday scheme).. Terrible upper management who dump things on you Promotions are very biased within the company, interviews are more for show when going for a promotion as the decision is likely to have already been made. Boring work, low pay, hard to progress, poor culture, role was not as advertised. Large turnover of staff lower paid roles. Low pay &amp; small bonuses Repetitive work Every promotion is highly competitive Some teams are managed worse than others Customer service clients are not nice to deal with Only 22 days holidays. Poor company pension - for a pension company! Astonishing staff turnover.   Few opportunities to move up the ladder, no matter what skills you have. Would rather cut corners than fix source of problems or deal with systemic issues.. Salary, although advertised as competitive, often falls short of the mark when compared to market competitors which can create a level of dissatisfaction within the workforce. Pay progression is also slow with little clarity on how to move up the pay scale. This is not helped by emails often sent by the board advertising how profitable the company is continuing to be. Despite being a relatively young company some of the views and attitudes held higher in the company can sometimes be a little Dickensian with regards to feedback and criticism.. - Soul-less working environment - Inconvenient place to work (no parking facilities and difficult to get to) - Opportunities for social or charity work only goes to management or C-level - Out-dated Working From Home policy - No trust of staff from Management and above - Promotions given based on longevity, rather than skill / experience - What they say and what they do are different  In my view, I have seen all of these things, although some apply to how other members of staff were treated, not me.. Pay falls very short of the market rate, progression is encouraged and easy if you work hard however wages barely increase.. Due to location parking can be difficult for those without a company space, although public transport links nearby are very good.. None at all from my perspective. I have no real cons about the place. What I have found is that where an issue is raised the business listen and try to react. Also, the business proactively look for concerns with an annual survey as well as ongoing communication.. Pension Contribution % is a bit low. pension contribution could be a little higher but all the benefits offered outweigh this.. Company benefits slightly worse than other places I have worked. The salary could be better when comparing it to other similar job roles. - low pension contribution - slightly lower pay than other companies. Whilst the location of the office is in an up and coming area of Manchester that is being heavily developed it can be difficult for some to access via public transport, in particular by train. A large portion of staff do however get access to free onsite parking.. None , , , ,. Low pay Low pension contributions. Car parking a joke, as its a lottery system. Culture is a big thing with The company, but in reality, it has a culture of sexism (unless you sleep with one of the managers) , bullying, finger pointing, cover ups and drinking. Might be worth the staff being breathalysed on payday Friday drinks, as staff are encouraged to drink to excess and drive home. Systems are a joke, constant IT failures, penalised by management on your bonus for not hitting your target. Management use sick pay as a weapon as to whether your face fits. HR are a joke, they dont care about your mental health, but boast on social media that they have mental health coffee morning chats available for staff, this is far from the truth as this never happens. They claim that they support the LGBTQ+ community, but in truth, the pride parade is no more than a publicity and promotional event. The toilets are unhygienic and stink. Unhygienic kitchen. So glad Im working from home at the moment. Senior management walk about the department in a bid to appear visible but they dont acknowledge you or talk to you. Its more like a power trip. None that I can think of. there are no cons currently. Salary is on the lower end of the spectrum.. Salary wise not much productive. Nothing much is negative to say. -Pension contributions -Cant think of anything else!. Pathological command and control culture. Managers completely detached from reality.  Aggressive senior member of staff using obscene language at daily stand up to describe other staff members and teams.  Manager behaving in misogynistic fashion making inappropriate comments to female members of staff and ignoring toxic behaviour within the team.  Passive aggressive HR department \"We use a Bradford scoring system, so don't ever get sick\". Bombarding everyone with pointless, endless mandatory training courses.  Ancient tech stack, rotten code base, irrational resistance to refactoring, changing or upgrading existing code.. Doesn't pay enough money etc. The training isnt always provided. started to become like a call centre. Its like a school playground. Very cliquey, unbelievably toxic environment, with harmful rumours spread and spiteful comments made if youre not part of the in crowd.. First the minor points: - Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business. - Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business - The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short. - Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.  The major failings: - HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go. - Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so theres almost a fear of being ill. - Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports. - Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But theyre seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture. - Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved.. Awful cronyism in middle to higher management. If you look the part and suck up to the right people then you can go far.. Pension contributions from employer are embarrassing. No pay rises during a year of record profits.. Poor salary, no freedom to express yourself. Wage i think is too low. Feel like one of many Underpaid to a degree. Pension contribution should be higher Bonus not the biggest Salary on the lower side for some roles Parking used to be a problem but not during lockdown. Under staffed, poorly managed, undelivered promises. You can call this AJ Hell. Pension contribution is lower than my previous employer, but the holidays and job security outweigh that.. No consideration to the staff, customer and sla is more important than any illness or mental health issue that you have, low pay for high stress job, compulsory overtime when busy, difficult to progress. Salary The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.  Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.  Management  Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed.   Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isnt which is lying to upper management.   Culture  Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams arent run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.  Promotions  Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit.   IT systems  The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close calls so it appears as though your issues are resolved.  Overall:  Good place to start your career or use as a stepping stone to advance your career.. Pay is not enough, too much work. Job stability, unpaid overtime and low bonus.. For me, not much. I would like to be paid more (who wouldnt)  but theres still good training and study opportunities.    Theres not much to the social side at the moment for obvious reasons but its good to see online events happening like cocktail making.  Theres also access to online exercise classes and PTs while the gym isnt open.. Where do we start?  After being offered the job you realise quickly youve been given a position in the  overworked scapegoat department.   Pay variance- its massive between us some admins. Although its top secret, you are not suppose to discuss what you get paid. If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if youre promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage.   You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued.   Never go against the gain- youll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime.   Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot!   Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they dont care!   Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.  MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.    Overtime- you wont get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here!   Dont appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. Im sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope.   Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like thats what your aspirations in life are!   Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.  IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk!   Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santas (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.  Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion.   HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. Its basically do as I say not as I do.. Overworked, underpaid.   Bad management.   Staff burnout because understaffing, compulsory overtime and too much business.   Cant get staff quick enough for how many people leave so pull people over from other teams.   No concern for mental health or wellbeing unless they can write a blog about it to share on the intranet or publicly.   BARELY following Government Guidelines for COVID in comparison to other corporate companies.   HR act like they are on your side but are just there to find loopholes to make your issue your problems and not AJ Bells  Managers and TLs do not listen to their staff when offered suggestions to lighten the work load.. Senior management, planning, systems, HR, pay gaps, bullying. As such a large company, it can be hard to get to know people outside of your team. Low pay for the work that is carried out Overworked staff Limited growth opportunities Management don't seem to listen to the needs of their employees. Pay could be better and the pension contribution is a little low. Some systems and processes are still developing to back up the rapid growth. Progression can be challenging within the admin departments. Salaries below external market rates Employee benefits need improvement e.g. employer pension contributions Limited opportunities for experienced people Micro management work culture No flexi-time working available Statutory minimum annual leave. Benefits package is below standard. Progression. Yes you can progress if your face fits and you don't disagree with a decision from the top. They have a habit of promoting some shockingly bad people to managers just because their face fits, never mind if they can actually do the role. It's not the case in all departments but just the majority especially customer services.  People have been told outright not to apply for promotions as they want external candidates but then hire someone internal the week after.   A fair go. The company currently utilises the government levy for apprenticeships and this includes team leader and management courses. To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.    lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug.   bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses arent assessed fairly and they vary department by department.   poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking.   Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied.   All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places.. - Piss-poor salaries. Clearly taking advantage of young workers who don't know better. No payrises across the board in a year with record profits, record client growth and record shareholder dividends. - Management is stubborn does not welcome creativity or new ideas - everyth - Insufficient resources to get jobs done within service level agreements. Approving budgets to increase headcount takes place at a glacial place by which point teams are already way behind. Place seems to be run by stingy bean counters who don't recognise that explosive client growth is going to require similar increases in headcount. - Management does not listen to valid concerns of employees and prefers to shut down viewpoints of employees who go off-script - Few opportunities for meaningful progression unless you are willing to brown-nose your way to the top - Long hours (8.45 - 5.15, why can't it just be a 9-5?). There used to be limited parking spaces for staff but this has changed with the move to more home working. Poor pay, poor pension matching considering pensions are a large part of the business, many departments are understaffed and there is pressure on individuals to cover the shortfall rather than giving teams the extra manpower they need.. Awful company to work for. Pay and opportunities are rubbish. - AJ Bell like to hire youngsters fresh out of uni or from their first job at a shoe shop with no financial experience. This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with. - AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated. - It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them &amp; make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave. - The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away. - Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management).</td>\n",
       "      <td>Numerous complaints cite low pay compared to competitors, limited career progression often favoring those \"in favor,\" and a toxic work environment characterized by bullying, lack of recognition, and poor management.  The company culture fosters a \"face fits\" mentality with biased promotions and HR failing to address employee concerns.  Outdated systems, poor benefits, and high staff turnover further contribute to a negative work experience.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Generally very good life balance and hours. Fridays finish at 5 instead of 5.30 and for three months of the year you get to finish at 3pm and enjoy the summer. Last Friday of the month the company puts on free beers for staff. Also a good thing.  Generally a very good, close IT development department with many highly skilled and clever people pushing each other to expand their knowledge.  The company covers some really interesting technologies and there were opportunities to learn lots about emergent tech trends which could shape the site and various tech products in the company further. This \"give it a go\" attitude is something they should be proud of.  Fortnightly sample sales are good but over the years less good stuff was in them - I think the buyers themselves started to take anything they want home for themselves.. - Youthful staff - if you are in your 20s or 30s you'll be a good fit - Staff discount - it can save you a lot of money if buy lots of clothes - Colleagues - you can meet many decent people. Working day is 9-5pm, goes quickly and an opportunity to be somewhat creative. Looks good on cv  Great discount. good team and great culture in the company. staff discount and sample sale. All employees are treated well and respected at every level, great social environment, work-hard play-hard ethos. Despite having been around for 15 years, the atmosphere is young and vibrant and ASOS actively and successfully maintains its small-company feel.  As a technologist, working at such a huge scale is really rewarding. ASOS handles over 2 billion page hits per month and delivers more than a parcel a second to 240+ countries around the world, so the technology is vital to the success of the business.   Good people who are dedicated, motivated and work together.  Good benefits, 40% staff discount, sample sales  Summer hours - 3pm finish on Fridays from June-August! Friday beers and lots of other events.. Some really great people work for ASOS and some brilliant ideas are available to generally help improve the working environment.

The people.  The office is a beautiful layout. Lots of employee perks such as personal trainer, spa packages and employee sales.. Collaborative company where you feel truly cared about. I was so surprised when I joined ASOS at just how different the environment was to other places I'd worked. I already knew a few people that worked at ASOS and asked them what they thought of the company before I made my decision to join. The feedback from them was a resounding 'they really look after you' and that's exactly what I've experienced.  Opportunity to grow  quickly within the company, flexible hours and just trusting employees in general, good basic salary for the retail industry, great package, from flexi cash and bonus all the way to more niche things like bicycle scheme and holiday vouchers and having your birthday off work.  Amazing like-minded people who don't treat you as competition but as colleagues and friends, a company and brand to feel proud of, exciting things happening within the business and being able to feel proud of it.  Cool company feel and office space, awesome canteen, really buzzing and exciting atmosphere to be in.   Strong feeling that the Exec really care about the company which in return makes you really care. The CEO is in the office every day working like everyone else. He doesn't even have his own office, but sits in an open-plan amongst the rest of the employees.  The work ASOS are doing in CSR- the fact we have our own foundation and do tons of charity work is a massive plus for me. Working in a fashion company you can sometimes feel that what you're doing might not, in fact, 'really matter'. ASOS has such a focus on its charity work and every year sends its employees out to help build schools for homeless children in India, and wells in villages in Africa. They also encourage people to raise money all-year round, and are constantly organising fundraising events. It makes you feel really proud to be part of a company that focuses so much on doing good.. not to sign on at job centre. Sample sale.  Staff discount.  Summer Fridays.  Monthly Beers.

       "      <td>ASOS offers a vibrant work environment with numerous perks including summer hours, Friday beers, a generous staff discount, and sample sales. The company fosters a collaborative culture with opportunities for growth, innovation, and using cutting-edge technology. Employees feel valued and respected, contributing to a strong sense of community and a positive work-life balance.</td>\n",
       "      <td>For a company where it's shop window and everything behind it relies totally on IT, the directors seem to know soo little about IT and as a result have gone through a chain of hiring sociopath to sociopath to be in charge of large parts of or all of IT over the years. They want a new, interesting company like ASOS to be linked to their career and use big names of other (often much more stuffy) business to get in through the door, then pull the IT department back into the 20th century.   The worst one was a recent CIO hire who started with a statement of intent of who they are and what they want to and don't want to do. Very quickly each of these promises was broken. Even worse, heads under them were replaced by people they had worked with in every company from the past 6-10 years of their career. These people were not brought in on merit. The result was a very strong cult of personality driving people out of the company, a swelling contract budget (more mates brought in) and importantly very little credible, long term value to the business. Having worked at the company for a long time it made me sick to see such a sought after and popular company get taken in by these people.  Not unusual I know but HR really are the pits, smiling assassins but dressed up to the nines.. - Management - they had no idea what they were doing - it was a real mess and they didn't listen - Career development - the performance review process is really bad and not based on merit. Also, you can expect to be boxed into a job and not being allowed to get involved in anything else at all - Technology - messy, old, things barely work and frequently break. Tense atmosphere, newcomers are more or less ignored and not showed around properly. Far too much work to get through in one day, with low freelance rates - you're expected to work like a machine, and made to feel inadequate if there is a mistake. People seem uninterested, fake and cliquey.. Unfriendly colleagues - cliquey atmosphere Disorganised chaos of clothing in the buying department - barely enough space to get desk Managers are too wrapped up in themselves with no real idea of what is going on in their team. begins to be more corporate and more difficult to interact. bureaucracy, hierarchy, low salary, NO DIRECTION, politics, inefficiency, hr department disastrous. Some of the internal systems are frustrating to use, often required to work long hours but rewarded for hard work in other ways and always appreciated!. No BYOD policy.   Still some cumbersome systems and processes in place but getting better all the time.   It's in a listed building so the plumbing can be a bit flaky and getting a lift to the 6th floor can be a long business.. So much is going on it's a struggle for team and programmes to keep track and on top of things. Changing direction quickly and context switching is hard. IT is seen as a burden on the business.. Rapid change is great but it's hard for the resources and systems to keep ahead of what's needed. Cattiness, lots of clueless middle management. if no work got sent home or not to come in and did not get paid for this if you had any holidays you had to use them to make your pay up. As any business growing very fast there are some challenges to deal with such as not very helpful processes or some legacy technologies to improve. you may have to walk 10 miles in a shift, power hungry lower management, very high temperatures in summer 30 degrees+ , no allowed to settle in one environment constantly moved around to where workers required either receiving,put away,returns,hygiene,pick, pack, dispatch etc each with its own kpi that you have to achieve or face a disciplinary even if you have an accident you face a full investigation, alcohol and drug tests then another disciplinary, if you have time off due to genuine sickness they do not believe you and you face the occupational safety nurse to find out what you can do! If you suffer from asthma or any other lung/respiratory complaint don't bother as the dust and heat will put you in hospital.Poor Health and Safety every week there is a new regulation that you have to adhere to now we have to ware glove's for all \"dangerous\" conditions.The local doctors have two common ailments the ASOS cough (caused by the dust0 and the ASOS bad back (caused by the heavy work). Not that I can't do it I'm an ex miner but it is punishing running up and down five flights of stairs constantly!!. People have the \"I don't really care \" attitude to work No training whatsoever Outdated tools Cold office Salaries rises are given based on favouritism. One may get thousands the other pity pennies.(fact) Middle management has no management skills No room for progression Full of people bored who can't really bother hence nothing ever gets done Rules are not same for all Performance at work is an utter joke. One may get an above and beyond by doing little, though that doesn't translate into more money so why should one bother?. No real career progression and you sense the company prefers employees with no ambition so they don't complain about the poor pay and lack of opportunities. Staff are treated much like children.. Too many layers of middle management that don't fully understand what the team they are managing actually does.. Although they have some good ideas for their website and offer hundreds of products, undercover IT is a mess and at risk of falling apart. The culture is very immature and you are more likely to get on well if you stand outside the office smoking or go drinking lots.  there is  a real lack of structure and process which means they do things quickly but end up doing it twice or doing it wrong because there's a lack of clear strategic planning. the top guys are well though of, the bottom rung work hard, but those in the middle - no one seems to know what they are doing. There's a big bullying culture here. And you need to be very thick skinned to survive. There's a very high turnover for a reason. people leave without even having jobs to go to, just to get out. ASOS wants to keep the young start up mentality, but they really could benefit from growing up a little.. Progression and development.  Impossible processes &amp; systems.. Team/Department Politics, Lack of knowledge sharing across domains. The environment in the IT department seems to be that anything goes with regards to how things get done - resources poached from other teams to help get things done, last minute releases/fixes etc. Canteen really expensive Coffee shop should be subsidised. Senior management was a real challenge to engage with.  They need to do more to integrate sustainability into their core business model.. Can sometimes feel like there is so much we want to do and talk about doing, yet don't physically have the time to do it because of how fast-paced the environment is. I guess that's just down to prioritising workload.. This is my experience. If your pay is wrong there is little comeback. As regards flex hours you may be expected to begin shift two hours early at a moments notice and in spite of accumulating hours many employees' were asked to pay back hours! Ironically some were told to give back a week in overtime despite never being involved in any flex. When questioned HR would say they had access to information unavailable to Team Leaders rendering the Team Leader function a tad pointless. I feel HR didnt have control of the hours since being taken over twice. Oh and the handscanners are faulty so even though you can arrive in the car park 15mins early, by the time you use the clock in system inside it can reset and then go past the time expected in by a few seconds. Then the company charge you 15mins of pay for lateness. Targets are so high you can only achieve them by nearly breaking your neck, and if you have an accident you jeapordise employment. Good employees are treated like something on the bottom of your shoe, the lazy ones do well amazingly. Shift Managers waltz around like the second coming but I had no respect for the ones on despatch pick or pack. A Team Leader on Nights was the only one I respected but he's gone. Shame as now he has gone we have no one who takes us seriously, or treats us with dignity. Poor employer to work for.. Middle management politics! Too many contractors in IT for a very long time. Too many people trying to protect their own programs instead of looking at the bigger picture.  PMO could be utilise a lot more. Less politics and more direction leaders is needed.. CTO has issues. Either your part of his inner circle or he has no time for you. He knows best. Breaks the rules according to what suits him ( some very unethical ones) .Everyone else seems scared to disagree. Lost a lot of good people and will keep losing at this rate. Very political environment and rather cut throat. To survive basically dont challenge and query.. Too many Heads of Dept and too many getting promoted for who they know not what they know. Feels like you need to be a member of the good old boys club to further your career.. High growth business Constant pressure Changing properties. Cost and time of commuting. Systems can make work a bit manual and frustrating. Communication from management could be improved. some silly behaviors - immaturity at management level but think they need some training in how to deal with certain situations.. Open plan offices are too noisy.. Amazingly immature management. Whole IT team has talent in playing blamegames. Unethical behvaiour. Has a lack of direction, the company has many good ideas but due to high turnover at the top the plan is constantly changing. This can be frustrating for those wanting to see projects through to the end. It also means that you will work long hours. Whilst there are some great people there is also a lot of politics at the top.. The fact that its rapidly growing and evolving means it's a fast paced environment which may not suit everyone.. You're expected to put in very long hours and be on call 24/7.  The senior teams are very particular about who they favour and if you're not one of them, then you wont progress.  Other people in the business would go behind your back if it means they can get ahead.   Promotions are not based on value add to the business or quality of work. Flirting is seen as an acceptable way to win promotion.. I worked in the Customer Care team in London which was consisting out of 12-15 people from 5 different countries. We were the special advisors. My country team consisted of 3 people. One colleague was always listened to but us other 2 we were treated very special-. Throughout the whole team information was given only to the people who were good with the manager. we had 2 swaps within one year- the first leader really convinced me to speak about  if i would have a problem with my colleague. i said no cause I think these things need to resolve themselves -but he asked me in every one to one about it so that i thought he is interested and then I said what i do not like. Then the whole thing started. it broke up our team- instead of resolving it was always belived this one apparently only one knowledgeable member of the team and I feel betrayed for having said anything. Kept quiet went on working, Teamleader swap - became worse- the whole situation evolved again and that special person in our team got attention and everything and even in meetings with i higher perosn from the department the problem was not solved! It intoxicated my whole last months at ASOS becuase u felt like 2nd class people. Also in my reviews silly excuses were found that I do not reach the WELL DONE you need in order to be acknowledged or move to a different department whcih was my goal. I was not well done because I did a gap between a hiven and a capital letter and stuff like like this . I was always punctual or even over punctual at ASOS but even that meant nothing. The special person could be late 4 times a week ( yes we started counting and noted stuff) and they had always more cigarette breaks than others. Even behaving acc to the rules the next comment in my review was: You are better but still not welll done. No comment why on how instead poking on being sick one day! Was really not fair- felt useless with my colleague after a while and why they need us if the other person is so GREAT! This person btw was reluctant to show us stuff and always with a sigh and when I complained about it.they made a fuss ! Sorry for all these comments but I had a hell of 8 months there ( 3 were ok) and I seeked help but there was no support. and I want to make clear that this happened for Customer Care Specialists only! I love ASOS and what they offer to their employees really- by far the best I have seen. I left with a helpless sad and positive eye! I did not really want to leave but I needed to get out it affected my personal life and confidence.. can be all consuming...manage your time well and you will get the rewards. - Politics at senior management level - IT Changes are sometimes rushed through without proper testing - Turnover in I.T., there are some really good people who left. - Some teams/people can be quite clicky. team building activities could help with that.. Feedback not accurate Consistently criticised and not praised for what is done right Just a head's up, they will say \"can we have a chat?\" Take you off the floor for a couple minutes in front of everyone then tell you you're fired and have someone collect your things and literally show you the door. Happend to 20 people in the same day from different teams. The job is not secure considering most people who were being \"let go\" were only there for 1 or 2 months. Even being 1 minute late 3 times can cause you to be fired. You've been warned.. - not global thinking enough sometimes - sometimes fun comes before business! - workload is mad not giving you much time to think or be strategic on occassions. catty, negative towards assistant levels, a lot of overtime, lazy assistant buyers. - There's not enough space - desks are small and meeting rooms are always booked out - Things change...A LOT. I wouldn't recommend ASOS to someone who is not flexible or someone who doesn't like change - It can get very intense, it's busy all the time but mainly because people are really passionate about what they do. If you are a beginner in Customer Care rules are very strict. - Political - Unprofessional - Infantile - Arrogant - Treacherous. kpi is too high,no union on site,management don,t care about you,threat you like a slave,it is too long the list ,so if you can avoid this companny,they don,t care if you go or stay,you are only a number for them,. Over worked and under paid. Expected to work 12 hour days without  recognition or reward. I faced bullying from my manager, who made my life a misery by constantly putting me down and funnelling  her stress onto me and basically made my life hell. I reported her to HR but they didn't resolve anything.  Basically.. if you get on with your manger and he/she gets on with their manger you will be fine. if not you will have a tough time.. Upper Management and the way decisions are taken could lead to disappointment. Busy supervisors could/should be more present for their subordinates Long hours. overstaffed, weak members of staff. Poor middle management Inexperienced Team Leaders with poor micro-management skills Promotions based on popularity contests Treated like children. the whole place, from the top down all management have a bullying mentality and will get rid of you one way or another, they say there's no do's and don't's but done believe it! thats all the whole place is, questioned if you go to the toilet or make a drink, told off for being too productive, can never get holiday, all the bad reviews are true and the good ones are from people whose faces fit or have rose tinted glasses on, the latest news reports about the warehouse are true dispite being denied by executives! customer care is exactly the same and people need to see what asos are really like and how they treat their staff!. No career progression is possible. Cannot think of any at the moment. Company is growing very fast, you will need to keep up with everything.. Bad press which is a shame as the company seems to want the best for all it's employees and if there is a problem there are plenty of people that would love to get involved to change that.. Some areas still need a bit of improvement - such as in the QA leadership and some areas of the PMO. However I believe these are being addressed. if your face fits you'll be fine.. Chaos chaos chaos...everything happening very very and too fast. People that are more then 5 years there are marked and usually do not do much...except hiding knowledge to keep the status and being untouchable.. Terrible management. Low pay. HR doesn't care about employees hence the massive turnover at ASOS.. - Salaries aren't great - Big pushes to improve systems don't address underlying problems - Mostly a chaotic ride - Massive turnover of the best people - Layers and layers of tech debt (bad SQL, bad VB, countless architecture re-starts).. - not enough flexibility on dates of holidays - if you live in London, the commute is tiring  - you don't have your own desk. No progression - Colleagues allowed to get away with not working to standard. Inconsistent management, cliquey and often juvenile peers, lack of structure, and the HR team make far too many mistakes without ever fully resolving. Shift work, with a strong emphasis on conflicting early/late patterns.. - Maturity - Efficiency - Nothing else I can see. Wouldn't suit you if you don't like change and a fast pace. It's hard to move up the ladder. Compulsory 1 year needed in your role before you can move departments, even if you're skilled.. development is a little slow as it's a very set structure. Long hours!. Honestly i cannot think of any cons to working for ASOS that i have had even under the most stressful of times such as the site being down everything is handled amazingly and there is no real blame just learning experiences.. There's not quite enough space for all the new people but they're working on it. Also, sometimes being a big company makes it hard to get things done as quickly as they could be.. Useless and incompetent HR, no room for internal promotions, overstaffed, hot packed office, lots of politics, poor working conditions, too much lying.. Slow progress within the company. No real management support.. Questionable appointments to team leader roles, to say the least. This side of the company was expanding fast, so I can appreciate the need to fill the roles quickly, but it really was a case of whoever applied for such a role were either given it or asked to fill the role in probation form. It's great that they tried to promote from within, but some of the people were just not suitable for managerial type roles. It's as simple as that. Also towards the end of my time, they began to start taking privileges away from staff, in the name of efficiency. Not the way to motivate your staff or get them on side.. Slow Progression, but you do get there eventually The pay can be quite low. The workload can be very stressful. Stressful  Workload  Wage lower than work put in. - management - have to be a member of the 'old boys club' to get promoted. It's not the easiest place to work. It can be frustrating  at times and the turnover of staff is high.. 8 emails per hour target isn't always achievable - you can get a disciplinary for repeatedly having a low email average over shifts.   Progression can get political; managers know who they want to help.. Oppressive work environment. Unrealistic targets. Constant monitoring. Having to walk excessive distances of over 8 miles a day.  Not enough water stations. Timed toilet breaks.. Big company with lots or red tape and politics, mismanagement within team, hard to progress, favoritism, work can be monotonous at times.. - The job gets very repetitive  - Shift work. It's bad because the team is so young and not enough experience.. Working in Tech from a management/employee perspective is awful. There are a handful of really good managers who care about their staff. However, the others are simply greasy pole climbers who want to dine at the CEO's table and will do what it takes to get there.   There is no clear direction regards where is Tech is going. A likeable CIO has been unluky to have inherited a group of children to guide him. Am not going to mention names but avoid and Enterprise Architecture like the plague as it has caused more problems than solutions and if you want to commit career suicide, join Service Operations. A truly rank function that wouldn't know its backside from its elbow.. Huge Building so can get lost and IT Support can be delayed due to size of company but not really a 'con' - shows how well the company are doing !. extremely boring and stressful job bad management experience. Dispite the rules and processes Management use the egos to make up different one and contradict each other. Underqaulified and lazy Mangers some mangers are too scared to pick up the phone to call customers regarding their complainants and adviors have to do it. Managerment will shout and talk down to adviors.  A lot of offices politics. Staff can be very Cliqy as every one knows each other and some have generations of the family working there.  The old office was very dirty. You have to sale you sole to progress and for some that still isn't enough. You will be promoted for exerimental processes then demoted.. management to ridge, way to much inter office politics. Pay could be a lot better.. Myself and several others I know, have had a terrible experience with bullying here! The name calling, nasty remarks, rumours and career progression sabotage doesn't just stop with other customer advisors, some of the team leaders and senior staff also enjoy getting involved! During my ordeal here, I suffered with workplace depression, this was just labelled as attention seeking or drama. If I, or others tried to confide in management about the bullying it would just result in victim blaming and you'd be seen as the problem! An older team leader would often send inappropriate messages to young advisors, I too received these and was later pestered for a date. I was treated badly and humiliated here right up to the end of my last day. It really was awful! After leaving, I needed counselling for depression and anxiety. I am still affected by the experience now. I have heard from remaining employees that the bullies have found new victims and so it continues.. Sometimes stressful,  very often short handed. - The company is massively expanding so there are some building works going on at the moment. Expected to work very long hours. My team wasn't very well managed and failing badly which resulted in a bad atmosphere and limited support. being managed like a child - although a lot of are young.. Some staff very careless due to trying to hit high targets.. Not always room for career progression it can take a while to progress to next level.  Flexi time isn't really flexi time as it has to be agreed in advance. - becomes more and more corporate - new management coming in is attempting to turn it into M&amp;S - no chance for internal career progression. No progression. Need to be popular have things. High turn over. Salary is not great, although it's adequate if we consider the benefits. Sometimes there are a lot of bureaucracies and a bit of disparity between teams in the technology department. Deadlines are sometimes not realistic and quality can suffer because of that.. - Rapidly expanding company so culture shift is happening, but that means more responsibility on people to self manage themselves and their careers (so not really a con but still watch out) - Not much governance and processes in place so larger projects tend to be frustrating to work on. At the moment there is quite a bit of building works on the office to cater for the expanding workforce, so it maybe noisy at times.. - Not as agile as it could be, although continuously improving on that front. - Teams still lack autonomy.. Takes forever to progress, workload can be really intense, low pay. You are expected to work well beyond your contracted hours and made to feel bad if you leave work on time- I was asked on several occasions so come in on the weekend to work for no extra money/time in lieu!! It is extremely fast paced and as the company is 24/7, you are expected to work non-stop without any flexibility. The pay generally is also very poor considering the size of the company and competitors out there. Recruitment process was also poor- people got hired because of WHO they know, not how good or qualified they are.. Have to switch shifts all the time, sometimes working until 11. Constant monitoring, system is like school. The targets they set are unrealistic, you should do a certain amount of emails/live chats/social an hour and it just isn't possible some days. One to ones you have every week with your team leader are very hard - if you make one mistake you are made to feel guilty about it and as if you are failing every aspect in life - almost a bullying tactic. The company offer no support if you are struggling or having problems outside of work. Team leaders would go missing for hours on end and therefore my team had no one to help us except the odd team leader you could find.  Most team leaders didn't have a clue about half of the policies and I feel that does not set a good example at all for new people. One last thing is keep an eye on what you say to anyone there, there are always people higher up than you watching you and monitoring you. Never discuss anything personal with your team leader or share any opinions on anything with them, they claim your conversations with them are \"confidential\" and make you feel like you're their friend, they're not. They write down everything you say and relay it all back to their management, even private things - which a company is not strictly allowed to do. All in all - would avoid working for this company.. Turnover is really high in tech, company losing great people constantly. Service ops full of corporate climbers, doesnt represent the company or brand at all. Young people wanting to move to other areas of the business or have left in general. Politics and clique groups. Where do I start? BULLYING, this place is a playground for sociopathic morons who if they see you as a threat will 'investigate' you for stirring your coffee too  many times. They will dumb you down, you can't use 'big' words their banned because they don't understand them. They treat you like rats in cages; they have colour codes for your productivity- it will start reasonable; 3 an hour and then it will get ridiculous; 10+ customers so that's live chats, emails, social the works you'll be expected to diagnose, read through the chain and notes in 2 minutes with a cherry on top, they also monitor your 'quality' so expect to complete the feats of a robot for 11000 a month after tax. They lure you in with a 700 pound bonus if you pass probation, but the jokes on you because you only get  it  6 months after passing probation! This company will have you jumping through hoop after hoop and will exploit your desire to do well. You're under constant surveillance; expect  a battleaxe to be walking around sniffing out for a DPA  breach which is just being on your phone around the computers. Once you pass your probation though you can work from home? If they let you go you will be humiliated and escorted out of the building by security.. Do not support mental health HR do not support you Some teams are very clique and use bully tactics No one to speak to when in trouble Do not train you properly if at trainee level. This is a cliquey place and cliques are kings. From day one you will understand, if the clique accepts you, and then they will set the pace for you. You won't have much choice, you will eventually succumb to what the clique dictates. If the clique doesn't like you, the backstabbing will start almost immediately and it will be ferocious and merciless. You will find no friendly soul, no person to confess your thoughts, no friend. Everybody 100% will do their best to bring you down to your knees. If you don't leave by your own accord, they will eject you.. This place is absolutely horrible. Please ASOS do not reply to this message with an automatic response saying that this is not the case. I worked there long enough to see what kind of place it is.   The advisors are constantly monitored, if you don't log in on time you will be told off even if it was a work related conversation. The weekly one to one  feedback is even worse, according to them it is our moment to shine but the truth is far from that.  They will just tak about how to improve the quality score of your response and the productivity report.   Management is really underqualified, half the advisors working there have more qualifications than them.   They didn't even let me quit in peace, management was constantly gossiping about me until the day I left. I couldn't even say goodbye to colleagues properly.. shift patterns make making plans difficult. Pointless one 2 ones each week.  New inexperienced team managers, who where out to save their own skin rather than help, didnt know the processes, so couldnt turn to them for help, when stuck in 3 live chats and need advice quickly.turnover of staff a joke. The disperance in pay between team leaders and customer service advisor, when they didnt seem to know what they where doing. if they paid them a reasonable wage, maybe everyone will get paid a reasonable wage. 3 live chats at a time. It was like being on the phone with 3 people at a time.  Awful.. ASOS have policies put in place for a reason, like most work places. There have been a few reviews about productivity/quality and what people are expected to do... ASOS expect you to try your best. Some people cant and won't understand the policies but if you have a good work ethic then you would have no problem with this as you would be doing the right thing and following the guidelines.. Not a single thing  !! - I honestly cant think of anything. Shiftwork, which isn't great for personal life - 6am- 12pm. It's not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend working here if you're looking for a 9-5 and you're not truly passionate about your role or the company's mission. This is a not a company culture where you can  'phone it in'. You can have a work/life balance here, but it's easy to get swept up in everything that's happening.. Nothing - not that I can think of anything!. Treated like school children. Training inconsistent and processes absolutely horrendous for such a large company.. - Growing pains - Promotion and growth opportunities limited - Constantly changing strategies in Tech and poor connection between Tech Leadership Team and rest of Tech team. Worse place I have ever worked in my life. They treat you like a child in primary school, the Team Leaders are absolutely useless have no idea what they are doing all they do is walk around looking for answers as they are clueless. If you want to work in a company where you want to progress DO NOT apply for ASOS as 90% off the Team Leaders have come from other companies and have not been a Customer Care Advisor before. They watch everything you do like Big Brother there will give you stupid one to one meeting which is completely pointless and irrelevant. They FORCE you to call customers even though you have told them you aint comfortable doing them as you not familiar with all the processes yet, when in actual fact its the Team Leaders job to do it. When a member of staff has been sacked or had there probation extended everyone knows about it. The Team Leader I had was a BULLY he use to shout at us when we are not hitting our targets we couldnt even book a holiday with out being questioned he wants to know why we are taking the holiday and we have to ask him for a holiday even though it has been authorised already. Also was told to kiss the top managers bum to keep my job. When you have made a minor mistake they bring you into a room in front of everyone and tell you off like a child couldnt wait to leave this company.  AVOID ASOS. Alot of office politics and favouritism. The customer care centre is poor run by ego. childish managers treating the advisors like children. You cant even go to the loo when you want. you are monitored tirelessly and patronised. There is a bery high turn over of staff.. Can't think of any cons. Team member should be briefed on the role of the intern and how they should delegate work Managers can be flaky with guidance  Competitive. Literally everything, security being horrendously tight, worked until you drop, sexual harassment to female employees, accused of being drunk, attacked by another employee.. Boring Shift It seems like a school. Unrealistic Pace/ Very 'Clique' at senior manager level. As a relatively young company it lacks the structure of other organisations, but makes up for it through atmosphere and working environment.. Prepared to be ignored if you're not part of the boys club The Tech teams are run by a bunch of bullies, it's their way or no way, even if their way is the wrong way Hard work and results are often over looked, and people are based on who they know  If you're a female in Tech don't expect to be paid anything near your (junior) co-workers. Low salary for entry level jobs. Quite informal, catty advisors to team leaders to performance managers, They lie when they say it's easy to progress. The discount was just amazing !. Not that I can think of!. I was sacked for literally being 3 minutes late when another girl on my team (white) came in late 25 minutes and was regularly late. No one said a thing to her. Manager was obviously bias and much friendlier with the white people on the team. I had been performing very well in all other areas but being one of the only ones on the team who lived a little further away I had had a few lates (max 8 mins) which I was always happy to make up at the end of the day. Shifts were terrible, your social life is non-existent with the crazy shifts you're given and they still have the cheek to constantly ask you to do more overtime.  I failed probation because of being 5 minutes late and even though the manager knew this she wouldn't tell me when I asked her at the beginning of my shift. I told her I felt sick and just wanted to know. She made me continue doing the work and said that there was nothing to worry about. My uncle had passed away the night before and by the time they finally arranged a probation review meeting to dismiss me and end my contract I was feeling very sick and I burst out into tears. They are honestly so harsh and they don't pay their employees much and try to make up for it in 'benefits'. Not acceptable.. Unfortunately people take advantage and dont pull their weight. Too much middle management Too many stakeholders Lots of politics. 3 sign off segments before being promoted. Only have opportunities be signed off twice in the year. Slow progression.. AGILE DELIVERY Managers are generally poor developers from other companies trying their hand at management. ASOS are not good at hiring good managers, I've only had one that I've completely respected and he was promoted twice, rightly so.   Poor understanding of the progression process, the skills chart has been updated so many times, no one really knows how to get a promo outside of the pub..  Facade of women in tech initiatives recently to push equality for women, when again women are still not getting equal pay. A wide spread adjustment was done very recently to try and address the difference in pay gap without mentioning exactly the reason why.. Shift work, nothing else to say. The best company I have been so far.  Hands down.. politics, made to work like robots.. Such a high turnover on all levels right to the top. That the management style , rules and office culture was always turbulent.   At time it was like a high school.. Lack of training programmes/materials Poor management. * Was not placed in the division that I interviewed for, which is absurd (and hence i did not stay long at this org) * My initial line manager was a condescending bully with numerous complaints against him * Some of the people were awful - dismissive, belittling etc. * \"Just do it\" attitude held by many managers * BIG boozing culture * Flexible working initiative not consistently implemented * The criteria for BA career progression was extremely opaque. The process was not explained during the interview process even though I very specifically asked about it * The division seemed obsessed with the process of delivery and not delivery itself; suffice to say our team delivered very little and I left because I felt this was going to look very bad on my CV * The staff turnover in tech was laughable (so high). -Politics. -Undermining and backstabbing. -Complete lack of professionalism (especially some Directors and their Mini Me Wannabes) -Heavy drinking and drugs culture (inc within the office). -Do as I say culture (dont do as I do, as I am superior)- hypocrites galore!  -Some vindictive personalities, especially within Tech -Bullying and Discrimination- discriminatory subculture exists (language and actions permeate directly from the CEO)  -Presents a holier than thou facade, everything from ethical trade to working conditions and equal ops- none of which is backed up.. It's chaotic and not in a good 'fast paced' way. It is just hugely frustrating on a daily basis.   Senior Management don't deal with poor Line Managers either.   Too many people involved in a sign off process.  Very hard to progress up through the company - there's no support from HR to do this either - so the only way to do this is leave.  For some departments, it's all about politics and egos.. The hours you have to put in are long, a healthy worklife balance isn't always possible.. - Still a corporate, things take time, lots of stakeholders. - Some incompetency in mid/senior management results in weak leadership and confusion. A lack of willingness to stand up and be counted on difficult decisions.  - The fashion side of the business often does not know what it wants, making it hard to know whether the work done will deliver any real value.  - Central teams who seem permanently unavailable, making necessary infrastructure changes near impossible, frequently blocking entire teams  - Somewhat chaotic and noisy environment at times  - Unprofessional/disrespectful behaviour in certain teams with management either participating or turning a blind eye.  - Significant unaddressed technical debt in some areas meant some teams were heavily coupled, causing significant pain in releasing.. If you dont fit in with the clique from day 1 you may as well leave. Management more bothered about hiding the truth so they look good. The bullying tactics used by MANAGEMENT seem to be the best way to get ahead.   On the outside its painted as a social fun place to work. Thats just code for drug taking and coasting through sign offs because youre part of the right clique.   Key words: backstabbing, fake, drugs, bullies, cliques, mismanagement, no mental health support, sexist, boys club, non empowering, no work life balance, poor salary.  When youre 21 and dont understand what a workplace should really be like. No one at ASOS will tell you otherwise or try to help. Not cool when its detremental to peoples mental health.. Difficult to move up with so many people working there.  Different standards held for different teams largely depending on leaders and managers. Very fast pace and changing, competition for progression. I have noting to fault about the role or the people.. No profession, can't keep up with the growth in Customer Care, don't get feedback from their advisors even though they are the ones dealing with customers every day.. Difficult to find Team Leader/Manager when there are problems so can effect performance.. long hours , can be tiring and stressful. Poor understanding of technical function and the technical director is very demotivating. - Bad leadership, very top down decisions - Central teams dictate how the platforms should work - Waterfal driven by big programs - Architecture decides everything before engaging the development teams, which at this point is too late to change. It feels like like im back in school sometimes and Id rather get more money than have drinks at work etc. theres very often no communication or a lot of miscommunication between the senior management and advisors. Theres no consistency in managing styles and there are a lot of people who should never be a part of the management.. Left on your own and hard to find help if needed. Teams are divided, if you get a good team, great, if you don't, you could experience some petty behaviour typical of fashion industries. Also you are VERY replaceable, which is a good thing too, but in my experience, people/managers didn't always keep to their word if they promised something.. - This is a retailer, not a technology company. The majority of the business sees tech &amp; product management as \"IT\".   - Product management largely sidelined due to organisational structure, separated accountability  - Fundamentally not a very evidence-based or data-driven business, but politically-driven; priorities usually set top-down by the \"highest paid person's opinion\"  - Don't seem to promote based on merit, but years experience/age &amp; politics. Results in employees' focus not being on delivering value for the business, but what politics they need to navigate to get promoted. Very often leads to incompetent leadership who can \"talk-the-talk\", but could never \"walk-the-walk\"  - Very frustrating place to work - huge opportunities that no-one is working on.  - Massive (very waterfall) change programs have slowed almost all forms of iterative development or innovation down to a stop  - Bloated, with many employees doing very little of value.  - Company takes the approach of throwing people at problems, as opposed to (usually very simple) use of technology to solve them.. Truly, cannot think of any. Hard to think of any. - Due to growth office is split in two locations.. Retail pay is atrocious, not competitive at all to my knowledge. Many people leave ASOS, go to Arcadia and come back on a higher pay grade and job title. Office politics exist everywhere so that's negligible Many levels to Promotions. Each JD is tiered: Entry Lvl 1/Established Senior To move up you must be assessed and or signed off. This happens every 6-12months in March &amp; September. If you start in Feb, or Aug you have limited time to learn the role then prove your worth. So will need to work very hard to step up 2 roles. Doing your job is not enough to be levelled up. You must be doing the role above to be signed off. You have no opp to show you can you must be already doing it. Workload can be great.. Working in the ASOS studios was one of the worst experiences of my life and badly effected my mental health. I had to suffer bullying at the hands of my team leader (who had received previous complaints prior to my employment) and handle everything entirely on my own, despite my cry for help to HR (on two occasions). It was only when I resigned that they decided to listen but even then my complaint was never taken seriously. The HR department are completely for the company and are not too concerned with the wellbeing of the individual employee. The management I was under are entirely inexperienced, socially inept and unprofessional. They are allowed to abuse their position of authority without being challenged. I'm sure many of my previous employees would agree that it is more like being back at school rather than in a professional working environment. I have heard more recently that people have had mental breakdowns working here, and I was on the verge. Don't be fooled by the amazing benefits and working culture, believe me, it's not worth it! As I've learnt, it's far more important to have a healthy working environment and supportive management with good morals than having parties and cheap clothes!. You can never find your team leader if you need help with something. They expect you to not make mistakes when you've been there a day, you are expected to hit your targets straight away and get told to hurry up if you don't. Don't even think about having a day of ill otherwise you are gone.. My employment was terminated due to a few reasons, some for not following process when I was only just taught it and one of which was a fabricated reason from a leader. It was that my behavior did not suit the requirements of the role customer care advisor and that it is not acceptable to say things like 'Thanks Mate' or  'cheers bro' to the Team Leader. There was no statements taken from either side or any investigation concluded, it was just taken as fact that I must've said it. Even though I did not know this until I was in the meeting my employment was being terminated in.  All I can say is, if they don't like you personally then they will do whatever they need to, to get rid of you. Even if that means making things up likemy leader did. They also have a negative snappy attitude towards workers but this is more due to the type of Leaders that were training my group at the time, the others seemed fine.  On the plus side the termination went smoothly and respectively.. Inexperienced management, office politics, long serving employees cruising and not adding any value. No clear career progression, information not shared. Promotion is little bit difficult. Not many cons to share. Bullying becoming more and more common with a growing blame culture and unfriendly teams. Management promoted on their technical skills and constantly lack the ability to step up manage their people. Lots of cliques and catty behaviour. HR are disorganised and ignore any real issues. They will always side with the most senior person in the room. Work life balance is non/existent- if you are given the rare opportunity to work slightly fewer days you are expected to still do your full time job in that time....with less pay. Health and well-being is promoted as important to the company but realistically they will ignore any problems and class it as underperformance.. Bad communication, lack of career progression paths. No cons, the IT department is broken down into smaller teams. Every team varies.. You get some feedback when you did something wrong about the process. Sometimes, it is kinda of tricky as the processes changes all long. They are attentive to employees feedback.. Monotonous tasks, job is very boring and repetitive. Long hours (I work nights, 4 on 4 off).. No bonus sometimes long hours. I dont really have any cons to be honest. Job progression, salary, very different to other businesses. Bad pay, they play on their benefits. Takes a ages to get promoted.. sometimes felt like it was a huge organisation perhalsp bigger than i am used to, which is purely personal. obviously the company could afford you the same opportunitties if it wasnt so large, not sure if its a con as such - more that it said i had to fill this out. Retail sector is volatile, pressure, stress, competitive atmosphere, unrewarding work (personal opinion). The only thing - far from London center. Hot desking Little progression Quiet office /awkward. the building is old and uninspiring but is currently being  refurbished!. ASOS has built a great business as a marketing  x IT business. As a result there is a monolithic tech presence organised around platforms not customer needs, preferring to take a shopping list of features than explore an ambiguous space and test and learn their way to creating true customer value.   In many ways this is a corporate IT structure from 2005.   The organisation remains heavily  siloed and the suggestion of cross functional teams working towards a metric-focussed outcome is treated with suspicion by tech leadership. One suspects because it threatens their power base.   There is a strategic vacuum at the top, meaning everyone decides what they think is important. This changes on a weekly basis as plans go out the window to chase short term wins.  I'm ultimately frustrated I couldn't do more to establish a different way of working but it was a tough sell in this environment I guess - you can lead a horse to water.... Theres a lot of support and maintenance which makes a developer bored  The office is too busy and noisy  Not enough writing code. Big corporation with a lot of management.. - People talk behind your back  - No room for progression unless you are friends with a lot of the TLs  - No support  - TLs are under the age of like 21 and have no clue what they are doing  - The wrong people progress. lack of real innovation, mismanagement of resources (financial, people), short sighted as to  the industry future, focused on short term sales, general fear of doing new things, london-centric mentality,. Too much stress for such little pay. No recognition for all your work. Everything went to the managers favourite member of staff. Not enough support from management and HR. Had to leave due to being too ill from stress with no help or contact from HR even though they said they would. Rude and arrogant management - They knew they were higher than you.... Very catty!!! I expected this as its fashion but not to that extent. Felt like I was back at school. No exit interview to ask how they could improve.. shows they didn't care how and why I left. All talk and no actions. Extremely over worked. From the outside ASOS seems an amazing company as everyone only posts the fun/ exciting things about ASOS but its not true.. This are very slow to release. when money is tight there are people doing 3 peoples jobs and people who deserve to be promoted aren't. Need to listen to the people in mid level positions more before making decisions which impact their job on the software they use. Also need to remember what people are inspired by, using all money for certain events where we're unsure of the purpose instead of salaries doesnt feel right.. -Gender pay gap -Promotions structure is not clear at all, women especially dont get the same opportunities  Very strong underlying sexism culture  they have allowed harassment and bullying  Completely unsupportive and disgusting treatment if you suffer from mental health(they will likely reply to this with a whole copy and paste job about how they dont tolerate sexism and they support mental health, DONT believe the hype) I am not the first and i wont be the last woman to leave because of it!Despite their shiny image and many benefits HR will always put senior management first and not take lower down employees opinions seriously. Its a very toxic work environment.   I strongly advise not to work in technology here or ASOS in general. I worked here for over 5 years and really gave it a chance but ASOS did not ever really change their ways. There are way more tech roles in London where you will be valued, respected and rewarded. Dont be fooled by the first 5 glass door reviews on here that are all positive most likely and written by ASOS HR, dig a little deeper and take on board the real honest reviews.. Everything is a Con! I don't even know where to start. No chance for career growth, especially for non english speakers. You are treated like a kid. There are so many problems within each market and the management just pretend everything is ok, they don't work to help costumers but just to look good to the CEO eyes. Over hiring: there are many many teams that do NOTHING all day or all night long, but they keep hiring people from outside so the good employees only have to leave. I will never understand why they do this. Constant hiring of mediocre people while they should only keep the good ones. They also keep creating new teams that absolutely make no sense. Micromanagement: Team leaders need to act like kindergarten teachers because their workload is ridiculously low so they just wonder around telling everyone off it they look at their phone or if they speak in another language, they really do not know how to keep busy.. - Your rights are exploited: - you get in trouble for using the toilet for longer than 5 minutes! this will also get used against you for reviews.  -get in trouble or sacked if your off sick -get in trouble or sacked if your late even though you have legitimate reasons.  -if your going through personal crises the team leader will use it against you to get rid of you.  -a lot of favoritism happens here. Unless you are kissing the team leaders back side you won't pass probation or progress.  there are some really good staff there who have been in the same position for a very long time and they are not progressing simply because the team leader and manager doesn't like them as their personal favorite pet.   -many of the team leaders don't even like doing their job - which is to help and aid staff! they want to just sit there and gossip.  -staff are young and immature, no good worth ethics and use passive aggressive attitude to get their way.  -lie on feed back forms. some information even get erased.  -it's like being in prison. You get told off for the most ridiculous things.  -Most of the team leaders and managers apply rules to staff they don't abide by.  -working on rota and weekends can really exhaust you. the pay is not worth it. -people end up feeling depressed there -poor ventilation and poor hygiene practice. Sometimes promotions are up to financials (even though the company has a VERY stable financial background) Mobile development is not agile, more like waterfall There are no feature squads, but teams are made from homogenous members (a team is all web devs or android devs for example). Cant think of any, fast paced and a lot of work like any job worth having.. Low wage, shift patterns that change weekly. Hard to progress. Shift patterns.. Do your physical and mental well-being a favour and avoid ASOS like the plague.   As a company, theyll go to any length to protect their precious public reputation and to scaremonger their employees to avoid word being spread of the evil and vindictive work culture that goes on behind the scenes in their offices.  When you start your job with them, youll be sold a dream of an employer that values their staff, drives personal development, as well offering great benefits e.g. staff discount, free onsite gym membership, monthly free alcoholic beverages on shift etc (which youll end up relying on, to help you cope with their diabolical management), but it doesnt take long before the cracks begin to show in their cleverly executed facade.   Youll have their company values to be Authentic, Brave and Creative drilled into you from the get-go, yet youll find yourself penalised and labeled as a troublemaker if they dont like what you have to say.   Progression and promotion opportunities arent rewarded to the loyal and hardworking employees, instead, theyre given to those individuals that spend all of their time gossiping with and sucking up to Team Leaders on company time, rather than doing the work theyre being paid to do.   Passion and dedication to your role go unnoticed, but theyll be quick to reprimand you for getting up from your desk to grab a glass of water, being a few minutes late back from your break or lunch or god forbid being off sick when you are unwell. This results in extremely high staff turnover and leaves people feeling deflated and unworthy. The number of staff absences related to mental health issues triggered by the workplace is at an all-time high.   In July 2018, ASOS signed the Time to Change pledge, stating they are committed to supporting those with mental health conditions without judgement and yet on returning to work, you are asked patronising questions in a formal documented interview, designed to make you feel guilty and ashamed, such as Do you understand the impact your absence had on the business?, which sounds extremely judgement if you ask me.   If the management at ASOS had an ounce of compassion for their employees, theyd realise that they are not robots, so they shouldnt be treated like one. Its about time that they open their eyes and use their ears to start actually listening to the feedback of their staff and addressing the serious flaws within their working culture before its too late.. shift work, busy, loud office. progression has slowed down a lot recently. Good company i dont see any cons. shifts, middle management, inconsistent pay. Whilst interviewing the company tells you how much they like to push their employees and how much space to grow there is. However if you work for the office in Watford you will have have almost no chance to move up and change to the London office, even if your skills are amazing, they rather hire externally. A lot of talented people get stuck there and can't build their career the way they wanted.. Many people who work here suffer a decline in their mental health. This is known and ignored by management. Long hours, pay just above minimum wage. This is the kind of workplace that makes you work the job that you're aspiring too for 18 months to 2 years before they take your applications seriously. If you do get a promotion you'll be working alongside external applicants who get paid more than you however have little to no understanding of how to do the role meaning internal applicants get paid less to do more as they have to pick up the slack.. Lack of diversity in management.  Gender pay gap.  Shareholders are more important than employees.. was there for a few months and was sent home because of lack of work at least 1 or twice a week was bad when you travel for over an hour to get there and only work 2-3 hours.. Feel like your in prison. With the strictness on being late after lunch or break by even 1 minute.. Shift patterns can be unrealistic for your body clock. If your a minute back from your lunch its like you have committed a crime. You have to ask to go to the toilet which they monitor. No progression. Poor pay.. long hours strict management racist mangers not enough money same music everynight. Bad communication  School like environment  Patronising Managers  Treated like a child  Repetitive  Low salaries. The social aspect of the company is being cut drastically, with no more xmas parties and cutting benefits such as discounts. None at all what so ever. Mediocre pay, not very stimulating, extremely process driven. Poor for development if you are at a lower level as they do not allow you to take any further responsibilities which means you can never learn/ gain real experience until you go to a different role somewhere else or stay in the hopes someone will leave and you can apply for their job.  Communication can be poor and often feels like you voice is not heard.. Redundancies happening everywhere - at a moments notice. Interview process was slow.. Management and the amount of pressure they put on you. Shift patterns were long.. Lack of management internally  promised bonus and not received. Culture and benefits are changing a lot, not for the good either! Cutting back is evident, which effects the employee experience. High staff turnover which can be off putting. Pay and discount, work environment is fun. - unprofessional, racist management - lack of structure and policies - no clear guidance on progression - not customer oriented - cool kids club  - lies used to lure people into the business - minimal sick days - horrible pay - terrible connection to leavesden - lots of pressure on advisors and staff - overcrowded building - terrible canteen food - drug culture - uneducated managers and no support - a joke of HR (people team) their HR advisors are not trained and everybody sat in their will give you a different advice, instead of speaking to each other and advising one  or the same advice - hypocritical behaviour e.g. asos advocates for gender equality, not racially motivated etc. but are the worst when it comes to racist jokes, sexist remarks and homophobia. Salary is way below market rate, and the way promotions work resemble a popularity contest.. Once you've 'learned the ropes' the work isn't challenging, most of the hard problems have already been solved and much of the work is boiler plate rinse and repeat.  If you're looking for pure software development then you may be disappointed, the software engineer role is more DevOps so much of the job is scripting and managing configuration where much of the job is spent in a web browser battling the tooling (although there are initiatives to solve this long term).  Not all the work is greenfield, much of the system is still in 'legacy' and thus you'll be dealing with horrible big balls of mud, but this is part and parcel of most companies.  They are very slowly trying to migrate to cloud based solutions but this process will take several years.. Overcrowded workplace where often some people are bringing their personal feelings and willing to deal with arguments from outside inside of a workplace.. There are so many changes happening at ASOS that its hard to keep up. Director has very little knowledge of the business, very little knowledge of what garment technology at ASOS entails, is very impersonal and extremely demotivating. They has made so many changes to GT that it is no longer representative of garment technology as a whole - it seems as though GT is being phased out all together. They've made so many wrong decisions and has limited progression and removed so many processes that during their time there, we've lost over half of the original garment tech team and they are not back-filling either, meaning that workload is pilling up and techs are being signed off with stress (all of which management/HR doesn't seem to care about- no support is offered) There is not a single member of garment technology which is happy in their job.  There is little to no training given when you start - I was being trained up by other assistants who had started not long before I had.  ASOS as a whole are struggling massively, morale is absolutely terrible as more and more perks are slowly being removed. Redundancies are being made left, right and centre  and its very common to be walking through corridors/go to the toilets/walk around the canteen and see someone crying.  When I started almost 2 years ago, ASOS was a happy and exciting place to work, however have fallen onto hard times but has become very corporate (something they promised wouldn't happen) in that time, causing a lot of anger and frustration with current employees.  It's a very hard time to be working in the Retail part of ASOS due to cutting headcount and upping the option count, meaning that there is too much work to keep up with, too much for the amount of people they have.  I also have suspicion that many Glassdoor reviews which are popping up are fake.   It is hard to list every bad aspect of GT currently so the best way to describe it is: Garment Technology is an amazing, fun and creative profession to have, however, ASOS is not the place to practice that profession right now. Times used to be different but as long as they have the vision which is currently being rolled out, you will not be respected or be happy as a garment tech there. Perhaps in a few years, things may improve, but right now, I wouldn't bother - for your own happiness, mental health and career.. The promotion scheme is deceiving: you can nail your objectives and it doesn't guarantee you a promotion whatsoever; \"well done, maybe next year\". The web team is crippled with managers and technical figures that are long past their prime. Product teams, design teams and development teams work in silos, making the everyday completely uninspiring.. Poor retention of staff, senior management chaotic.  Long hours, grown too quickly and lacks good working practices.. Young unexperienced employees are given carte blanche festering bullies that will do nothing good for your career and making your expertise and energy worthless, The HR department called PX is the most unhelpful department. Young admins are the gateway to nowhere. Overall the company values look great on paper but the reality is completely different and very disappointing. Feels like school  Inconsistency  Poor communication.. Lack of communication from the top to the bottom. Lots! expectation of delivery remains constant even though the numbers have gone down.. Management becoming more like Arcadia, reducing benefits. Reaction and change - working in a fast paced and changing environment is to be expected in any growing company but ASOS tried too quickly to grow itself. A 'chuck money at problems' attitude.  No confidence when collaborating with other members of the team leader community due to lack of management by their manager or experience.  Nepotism is rife within customer care and most 'support' teams are made up of friends who've been given free reign to offer roles to those who have zero experience.  Development opportunities are more of a popularity contest than of deserved applications - which shows in the recent cull of people at management level. There has been a restructure due to business issues which has seen over a hundred people made redundant due to bad business decisions made the last few years.  No-one ever really seems to be pulling in the same direction - too many members of management have difference of knowledge but not in a positive way (this is down to too many senior management only having knowledge of ASOS as a business - which is an issue since the customer care department has grown).  Very specific, but the term 'perception is reality' being used by high level management as a way of judging people's ways of working or personalities within their roles. This is frightening considering the amount of people that work within customer care.  Rumours, bitchiness and college-like feel about the place is the absolute worst. It is like being back at school (that's just the management).  The current CEO.. You don't get a discount when purchasing online as full-timers do.. Terrible management Stupid processes No opportunity to growing up. business has grown faster than the leadership and infrastructure. Very little progression and pay rises.. All other events are cancelled, which includes: Christmas parties, summer parties, Friday drinks and other engaging and fun activities No free fruit Poor communication between departments, you will never receive an answer for anything, new processes are sloppy and not well though through. No opportunity for progression or growth, due to recent company cutbacks.  All vacancies have been removed No certainty about anything Overconfident management, who are not even competent to do their job and just got the position, because they work in the company for a long time.. Massive workload, feels unmanageable at times Difficult to progress Competitive. Incredibly inexperienced senior managers, who are not qualified to do the role they were fortunate enough to be quickly promoted in to, right place right time approach, inherent favouritism. No structure.. better perks would be nice!. Too many people for one job, not much to do, poor mid Level management. Try to mould you into the same people. Say theyre flexible working are not in practice. very clique within teams,  personal development has become less of a focus over the years.. Many middle managers just don't do much or have any impact. C*O to this day is the most boring person I've ever met. I avoided going to any of his meeting  unless I want to sleep.. Like any customer service job is ripetitive and pretty boring.. - Exec board are out of touch with most departments - Sometimes it can feel hard to get some work off the ground - Redundancies were recently enforced. The handling of this was terrible.  - Sometimes its hard to progress (speaking on behalf of myself and multiple people across the business). Even when you do, pay rises were minimal although work could double or triple.. the unrealistic targets abd bad enviroment. Work environment can sometimes be hostile and tense, friends move up to higher places than hard workers and HR and management can see the inner politics and don't really care enough to fix it. Some people are given better treatment than others based on who you are friends with. Many people have left recently after being driven out by these tense and stressful working environments.. Lots of legacy systems, but that could also be a unique challenge for some. The company is currently going through a lot of change which can be disorienting.. tied very closely to MS stack. not much growth for architect overlapping roles and responsibilities causes friction between engineers and architects.. Not a lot of communication with the contact centre managers.. Management reduced the amount of benefits due to latest market results. Not allowed any breaks when you go to the toilet you have someone follow you too make sure your not having a break  some staff are ignorent and don't speak to you including management. Being  scrutinised for being a couple minutes late to work/break/lunch. Feeling like youre in prison. The fact there are some team leaders that think they can act as they please and when you do make a formal complaint, it doesnt go anywhere. Instead they fire you for it and give you some bs reason, like your performance isnt good enough. God forbid youre sick or have some personal problems going on, they dont care. They never really acknowledge the good youve done, they focus on the bad. I personally believe that some people have some sort of God complex about themselves and I honestly believe some of the people there have suffered some sort of a traumatic experience because the way they treat you its as if youre the reason for their pain, so you should suffer.. Challenging commute from central London. unethical progression based on favouritism horrible hours work every 2 weekends in a month makes you brain dead. some people pull their weight more than others.. Uninspiring and removed leadership.. Salary, no career progression. No career progression to manager role. Feedbacks are not always welcome, and when they are with data and analysis, not taken in consderation. No flexibility with shifts Canteen with not very healthy food. Many benefits being removed.. High level of mico-management, not much flexibility. Clogged with rude, unprofessional lazy middle managers. A lot of hardworking talented people at the bottom who have no opportunity for progression. No pay rises for 2 years (unless youre management). All the company perks have either been removed or had restrictions placed on them. People crying at work everyday. Forced to work overtime unpaid regularly. Workplace is a health and safety nightmare, people severely injured at work, Asos weasel their way out of it being their fault. No one wants to be there.. -Terrible pay  -gender pay gap  -poor management  - bad sustainability  -no progression -high staff turnover. beirachracy was a bit too much. No Fixed shifts Working weekends sometimes. Not great pay, hard to get promoted or make a difference.. Terrible shift patterns left me tired all the time and affected my relationships. Upper management does not have a clue.. Progression is extremely slow so you dont feel appreciated. Management doesn't know/care what's going on in teams, and salaries are far below average.. Senior management make frequent bad decisions. Pay not aligned with industry rate, across all lower levels. Sizeable wage gaps. highly corporate environment and lots of meetings. Too many to mention. too much micro managing no flexibility on lateness management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising shift patterns are pretty bad, knowing a sizeable amount of people commute in from London via public transport. no opportunities for progression within, lack of functions to manage team, lack of basic kpi's (removed and new ones not fully introduced at this stage: 6 months later), serious lack of support from senior management, no training / no development (1 year in role), no accountability on poor performance, false promise of salary reviews, ... , most recently removal of employee benefits. Discrimination towards language teams Very difficult progression specially if you arent English Management lies and unqualified Salary is basic and salary reviews very little They hire teens with no work experience or work ethics Redundancies are often. Treated like a school kid by higher ups. Poor organisation. Poor Communication. Un-motivating place to work. Alot of changes going back and forth.. - Pay could be slightly higher - Hard to develop and progress as employment is slowing down. Lack of leadership on teams from more junior manager roles, more corporate than before Workload. The line manager was always on holiday despite knowing I was just a starter.  Lack of training given. Make it as hard as possible for employees to progress and hire externally when they have plenty of capable staff already in their employ. pay could be more, could have more recognition for hard work. To stressed, ridiculous targets , and team leaders are bullies. Procedures are always changing and contradicting. The company wants blood out of you. The company is very dodgy and tries to cover its tracks very strategically. Racism still exists in this company if I could rate no stars I would.. Space for growth for your career feels limited. Nothing other than workload can get a bit heavy at times, would enjoy a better work life balance. - Poor internal communications - Asos is a place where management are terrible at cascading information that you need to know down the hierarchy. This could  be staff moves , supplier /relations. This will make you feel not important. - Poor systems - well at least in my role, you will have to do everything on massive excel sheets which are on the verge of crashing your computer down any moment. Asos needs some investment in retail systems - regular emerging last minute deadlines that could easily be planned into the critical path - emails are frequently sent with deadlines due in shorter time than it takes on average to complete the task causing a frenzy which breaks down the document that needs to be filled in - poor attitude to mental health - management haven't been trained adequately on dealing with employees whose mental health is worsening and the risk it poses to Asos.  For example when a manager was told that someone on their team is suffering from poor mental health because of things going on Asos they privately berated them for not having what it takes to work at the company and excluded them for being up for any promotional opportunities.. An extremely hierarchical company with thousands of employees, can feel like you are just a cog in the ever expanding ASOS machine. There is very much a \"wait your turn\" culture so although there are opportunities to progress, you had better get in line. Senior management certainly talk the talk when it comes to ensuring employee happiness but ultimately day to day I found the culture very cut-throat and certainly experienced elements of bullying.. Slow progression, low pay.. over work and underpaid, little opportunity and benefits continuously stripped. Reduction of perks over the last 2 years (xmas party, friday drinks, free fruit, reduction of staff discount). salary is bad, no clear progression to move up.. Low salary  and expensive food  in canteen. highly unprofessional and would not recommend at all. Heavy workload, sometimes impossible. Internal communication in some areas has completely disappeared leaving employees feeling in the dark, unsupported, wary of leadership. Atmosphere has become secretive and at times hostile. A series of poor decisions has eroded the great culture and atmosphere had been built. Huge turnover and loss of talent. Inconsistency between business areas.. The parties and some of the people. Lots of promises of development and progression that never come to fruition. Inconsistencies  with management methods.  The salary is not competitive.  Put the night staff through redundancy twice in 6 months.  If your face fits, you progress.. Management style sometimes very challenging. No benefits, low opportunity for development, company in crysis. No care about employees  Awful salary  No perks  Crazy hours. Work procedures are not suitable for certain markets.. Company in crisis Salary is not competitive Very limited opportunities for progression. I no longer work there. Change in focus, lack of reporting,. Abhorrent and humiliating HR processes Severe lack of care and understanding for their people Horrendous lack of development opportunities Poor decision making from top level which has cost hundreds of jobs Poor data management and reporting capabilities for a global company. Very strict and controlling on work completed. Extremely fake, gossipy environment, a lot of bullying going on. Buyers get away with anything they want, come in late all the time, talk to you as rude as they like. Its one rule for them, another for you. You could be late a few times in one week and and theyll pull you for a chat. But dont even think about mentioning theyre late nearly every day. Dont complain to anyone above them either, or ask to move teams as youll get fired, they are all close. HR do nothing to help or support you but team up, and make up a scenario with these people to get you fired. They wont even follow the correct disciplinary procedure, even when you have passed probation. I was the most hard working person on my team staying until 8pm most days, but it was never appreciated. When they fire you they will say you stayed late because you came in late, to try and make themselves look better, when you was hardly late at all.   Do not even think about showing an interest in a different area of the business, like they promote to you at interview. They will fire you for not having passion for your role. I tried to network and ask current employees how to get experience for the role and was told that was wrong, even when the replies were helpful. I asked the interviewer for advice on how to get experience after not getting a role and I was repeatedly ignored when all I showed was extreme passion. This will also get you fired because they will complain it made them feel uncomfortable. They wont just reply to you like a normal human being would, and put you at ease, thats clearly too much for them to do as a manager.  When youre getting dismissed they will list extremely pathetic reasons to make it look more legitimate. Even things that happened before you were at ASOS, because their source on information doesnt know all the facts. Never trust anyone, when they want you gone, they will use everything against you. I dont know how ASOS get away with treating employees the way they do. Dont even think about telling HR or your head that your job is affecting your mental health, you will also get fired within days, when they make up an excuse as to why. ASOS make out they care about mental health awareness, they are liars.   You are overworked here, and stressed out, it can take 2+ years to progress to a more senior position as everyone is very clicky. People above you will give you work way above your level because theyre too lazy to do it themselves but say it is for your progression. A lot of employees in buying do not last, as no one genuinely cares about you. Take my advice and DO NOT WORK HERE.. Management is lacking and lack of respect for the employees. Customers can only contact via online. Each time customers get in touch it will be with a new adviser even if the case is ongoing.. High degree of favoritism within a team, excessive office politics between teams, and HR has zero confidentiality  Employees are often on PIP with little time to demonstrate improvement before they are terminated. Promised progression and promotion that never happened Poor communication  Struggles to make simple decisions  Poor salary  Benefits being cut School like environment  Terrible hours with very early starts and late finishes including weekends and bank holidays. a lot of tasks need to be done. Shifts are different each week, targets to hit or you are out, watch your every move. No room to progress. A lot of redundancy issues.. Pay rate, growth in career. Shifts were different every week. Not given enough support and are technical. Progression slower than some companies I have worked for previously as you get higher up in level.. bad pay, badly organised/ managed and they timed toilet breaks. Awful management No communication Treat employees awfully Hardly any progression No work/life balance due to shift patter s. Made employees redundant as a group via casual conversation!. Difficult to progress and get promoted due to limited head count. Hard to progress, mixed salaries for same role. Due to rapid growth the office was under constant change.. Can be difficult to progress.. Terrible management, lack of training for new starters, no concern for health or mental health. Terrble handling of Covid. Extremely negative place to work in, feels like highschool. The company has grown rapidly over the last 10 years and some key systems have struggled to grow in tandem. These include development, recognition and overall engagement from staff. There is also a huge disconnect between senior management and staff, especially within CC.. Overworked, extremely competitive promotions, when put forward for promtions over 100 people go for an interview process with only one position available which is extremely hard to prep for as well as doing your day job. To get signed off you need to tick off certain tasks whihc are hard to when there is not enough staff and the role is so admin heavy. Busy environment, centre of London so expensive to travel. Upper management wasnt that great and didnt listen to employees. shifts were long and weirdly spaced ,one minute on earlies then lates. Underpaid and overworked staff in my position. Challenges with some senior management, and a bit of a blame culture, which makes it difficult for individuals to thrive. Culture of long working hours, little support for flexible working within retail. -Management treat you like a slave -Team managers are entitled to talk bad to you and treat you bad -They follow you when you go to the bathroom -Management time you when you go to the bathroom -Barista talk bad to everybody. Redundancies constantly, so not a reliable role Lack of communication. No sales bonus for staffs. Financial issues, risks of redundancy.. Their employees are the least important thing to them. In the past year myself and my colleagues have been through Several round of redundancy and not once offered any kind of support or an understanding ear from upper management. The ASOSers make this company who they are and to see them treated so poorly pushed me to leave. In my own person experience, I witnessed team leaders and advisors pushed to their breaking points with no support what so ever from those direct reports. Managers dont get to know the advisors in their operations or how they are working.. Some politics across the company between departments. - Management were awful. My manager was rude, aggressive, had no idea how to manage, would actively single people out, made my life miserable the whole time I was there, mentally attacked people and their personalities - just awful. She was a BULLY, no other word for it.  - HR did nothing for their employees despite numerous complaints about these bullies - The role was completely not what it was supposed to be, I spent most of the time reconciling invoices because the company is massively in debt to their brands - Brands were cutting them off because they owed them millions of pounds, quite surprised how they stay afloat!  - Very cliquey, and not very culturally diverse. You either have to be white or act white to fit in here. - Have clothes sales for staff but most sizes were below size 6 for females, makes sense and most of the girls there do look anorexic - General bad vibe, no one I met was actually happy there but stayed because of the company. No future No opportunity  Made us redundant to employ people in Philippines. Not so much a con but this is a fast-paced company so priorities can change quickly.. nights some workers seem to know how to cheat the system. Like a robot Xpo staff are superior. Inexperienced leadership and awful shift rotation. My manager wasn't a people person. Not good management, benefits were all taken away and pay was decreased. Stretched very thin, expected to step into full time roles with minimal training.. The lack of genuine progression due to being a high performer, a culture of favouritism and praise based on friendships- if you are here to be recognised for hard work and being a good person then you have come to the wrong place - this claims to value this but it couldnt be further from the truth. No cons that I can think of except for the size of the company and industry restructures are common. Robotic, constantly being watched. Everything is tracked. Very repetitive work, management sat around doing nothing getting paid over twice your salary which isn't particularly motivating. You need to be liked for the person you are to get promotion, easy for some but frustrating for others. Clone Culture, no diversity.  Toxic HR. School like environment, not much support from management. Organisational structure is confused but is likely to change. Overloaded with work and there is a lack of professionalism at times with no clear company guidelines. poor senior management and the CEO has shown his diversity, equality and inclusion is all a smoke and mirrors act. He has repeatedly shown he doesn't care about his staff unless they're high up or stakeholders. Office is like a school playground and if you're not willing to brown nose or fall in line, you will be managed out. Red tape, complex org structure and too many middle managers. Management in cliques prevent progression.. It's a young company which you grow out of and move on.. People keeps progressing just by being there instead of recruiting actual professional for certain roles. Admin Heavy, takes long time to progress. It's a safe place to work but not very much appreciated. they fib a bit about the future. Low salaries, over worked and very busy. Hard to progress, long hours. Bad terms, bad managerial attitude. Can seem lonely, as you work independently. Stressful and very hectic at times. slow progression, feels like you are not valued. The assistants earn 18-22k and this is not enough to live in London, especially when you have to get in for 6.45-7am on Mondays and rarely get out of work before 7pm. There is a culture of over-working and if you try to go home on time there can be comments (I should mention there is a clever clause in your contract that states that you might have to work overtime for free!). Also its very high stress for the pay you get and as much as some people are lovely, some are awful and on more than one occasion I've heard people crying in the toilets.. Salary, diversity, progression, work life balance. Little room for progression, redundancy, higher up decisions made for the business and not staff. Shift based job no work-life balance  Redundancy process not ethical.  Many cost cuts that effect employees. Unrealistic understandings in TA function and the differences between tech hiring and finance, vs fashion. Not a one size fits all. really bad experience with management, someone under qualified was promoted to a team leader role and this subsequently forced most of the team members to hand in their notice due to the poor leadership and lack of care for other employees. the person in question who was promoted was the only male person within a team of about 8 and also was close friends from school with one the head of post production, who then interviewed him for the team leader role. they didn't seem to care when everyone started handing in their notice and felt deflated and demotivated to work since one of the worst members of the team was promoted .. Management have their favourite choices of photographers Freelance job days are not first come first serve but whoever they see fit  Poor communication  Will drop you without any explanation. why do I have to do this. management felt distant and cliquey i don't want to be part of the fast fashion business model that based on news and research is causing a lot of issues for the poor around the world and our planet. Too many manual processes, low salary for the amount of work, work role status is in limbo after CC redundancies. Too much bureaucracy involved meant slow paced work. perks were good at first but were stripped back, unequal pay, poor manager (as direct reports, we had more experience and knowledge than the person we reported into). Fast paced and big company, hard to stand out. Outsourcing to other countries CC is not based in UK anymore. A lot of empty promises in the end as a lot of us were made redundant (not due to COVID). Hard to progress, very limited opportunities. Slow progression within the roles. Unprofessional Company culture  Company values training programs community involvement. customers can be abuse sometimes. Customer Care now minimal and outsourced. micro management, very little opportunity for progression.. No cons, great company to join. There was a bully mentality, progression was not an option in the HR department unless you conformed. Opinions or hard work was not valued or recognised. In turn led to a lack of support or care for HR employees mental health mainly caused by a toxic work environment.. No progression, poor management, redundancy. Bus times are not great from Barnsley asos. Fast pace and always lots to do!. Continuous redundancy in the company, workload is high, slow progression and bad pay rise. Reduce workload and hire more people!. Lack of care for employees. Rubbish management You're treated like a child Never an available manager when you need one Managers don't seem to understand the job of standard advisors. Lack of work life balance and flexibility. So many levels promotions are slow. Fast paced with heavy workload. Some benefits being taken away. Micro management, no progression, redundancies. Senior management not very professional and ceo all about himself. micro management, redundancies, no room for progression. - Micro managing QA leads - Projects didn't have direction and were running over budget - Business didn't have much confidence in the tech team. GLC is still running, and it's clepotocracy, management make their own promo codes and senior management rob the company. Old CCM signed a nda after paying his own private company hundreds of thousands. The company is messed up to it's core The watford office smelt of drugs and GLC you find powder in the toliets. This is all acutally true. You could make a movie from ASOS. DO NO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. Salary isnt the greatest for the level of work done. Low hourly rate, unsociable hours. Quick to ideation, slower to deliver. Has become corporate as it has grown up over the last decade. Democracy is a plus and drawback as there can be a lot of meetings and little achieved.   If this were a smaller company I don't think it could sustain the meetings and design by committee approach. This has gotten worse in the last decade.  Recent restructure is, in the short term at least, very inefficient and came just before the most demanding part of the financial year (Black Friday Weekend). Bottle neck for progression Becoming more corporate losing core values. Poor progression Low salary progression Extremely competitive. Big walks you know man. extreme levels of workload with little relief. A lot of constant change. Feels like very slow progression. Salary does not show that they put the workers first.. Accept any roles in London headquarters only. nothing wrong, I can't think of anything. Can be long hours but this is expected. Over worked and under paid.. Pay is not a lot for my self personally.. Progression is not quick at this business. There is no possibility to grow internally. You wont understand a thing thats management is doing. Low pay and slow career progression. Below industry standard for pay. The only other issue I have is how management speak to the rest of asos. See below.. Haven't experienced any in my time there. Lacks structure due to fast-paced nature. Fast paced well established environment. Long hours poor time management and slow progression. Much more needed around flexibility - so behind the times. The Customer Care Graduate Scheme did not guarantee a job upon completion. The majority of grads ended up leaving as a result. - benefits slowly diminishing - no bonus in all my years there  - discount reduced - lack of progression/ development  - lack of movement within company. There is ZERO accountability for line managers Not encouraged to move sideways into different departments Transformation programs very messy. No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,. hectic and poor communication with little career development. Increasingly corporate Lack of diversity throughout and within board Made to come into the office throughout COVID So much work and not much appreciation. Culture, poor management, underlying internal politics, poor recruitment, poor policies. A lot of benefits have gone. Our team has lost two thirds of the people but there's the same amount of work or more. No time to focus on personal growth or anything else because there's so much work. Design leadership also gone so there's no direction or inspiration any more.. Expensive to get to each day. You need to be the management favourite. Poor management Salaries Low opportunities Strict processes Too far away from the train station. Autocratic, very bad culture/behaviours, misogynistic boys club, wild. Management / top level / pay. very cliquey, lots of micro-managing. Secondary school environment, slow progression you have tiers in the job roles eg MA has 3 levels to pass to become an AM could take up to 6 years to progress to the level above. Pay is shocking youll get better pay in a supermarket, no disrespect. It isnt what you think it will be I wish I listened to the reviews before I started. Expected to work long hours without recognition. Treated like a child. - very poor work life balance, WFH not a thing - progression is tough and there's a very much a favouritism culture - lots of unnecessary admin. None, that I would like to comment. Not enough hours a week. discount cut redundancies no more staff appreciation days no job security. very strict timings on breaks- micromanaged. - No work life balance - All benefits have slowly been reduced.. Slow progression Slow integration of new systems. Not as many opportunities for personal development. Where do I begin. Everything was wrong from the start. They were not geared up to welcome new starters and I waited 8 weeks for the systems access in order to do my job properly. I then waited a further 4 weeks for my line manager to hand over jobs to me because they are the worst micro managers and dont know how to delegate or manage their time. On top of that the blame culture within ASOS is the worst I have ever experienced, no one is accountable for anything with a lot of people looking to hide mistakes, blame someone else and talk down to you. I have spent the last 5 months being gaslighted by my boss who is incompetent and thrives off making people feel bad about themselves. The systems at ASOS are not fit for purpose and you spend 80% of your time waiting for reports to run/information to come back and even then you have to run 3 reports because the reporting system cant handle the amount of lines youre reporting on. The whole set up is a waste of peoples time and skills. I am fortunate enough to have never suffered from my mental health prior to working here but the way I have been treated at ASOS means I have suffered from the worst anxiety and panic attacks ever. There hasnt been a day I havent cried or been treated poorly and the job isnt worth it, the workload and the pay is the worst. Dont put yourself through it. They email on sundays and at 9pm + and it is not conducive to good work life balance or a happy lifeX. Sometimes can feel a little hectic, so not everyones cup of tea. However if you can handle it, youll thrive at ASOS.. toxic culture, boys club, lack of progression. the only cons no many Career Opportunities. Low salary in comparison to competitors. Have to think about it. Progression based on who you know rather than skills or experience All employees are disposable. Office politics and high turnover. There are no cons from working at asos. progression was slow and managers made it clear the level difference. Long and expensive commute from London. Big company so can get lost amongst other employees. Long hours, weekends, not enough event parties,. Weekends work management not great either. No bank holiday extras. Gone into administration. (Glassdoor would not let me select this option). the working environment could be more diverse. Very patriarchal and unrepresentative at the top.. I never openly talked about my religion but I am muslim with a black girlfriend. The culture in the ML team around ethnic minorities and muslims is disgusting. A very undiverse almost like an Oxford version of Google rejects.  Long hours with weekend working  no progression unless you know how to stroke egos  The team don't understand experimental research methods or machine learning outside of neural networks  extreme bias against working class, BAME, and muslims.  Product owners don't know much about product ownership or management. Expect you to do a job three times your salary and wont progress you. Progression is dependant entirely on your personal relationship with your team leader regardless of your personal qualities.. Dont reflect that in salary. night shift were quite long. Hours too long and different. VERY SLOW progression and not enough time to do all tasks. Always too cold, shifts, management. lack of career progression, management go on holiday when you're a new starter leaving you to manage a department on your own, you work long hours with no appreciation. long hours, and difficult technology. very little/ barely any room for growth  admin heavy   no pay for overtime. lack of support &amp; work over time. no cons loved ever minute of it. No cons for me was a very good experience. Some organisational complexity in achieving clear outcomes. Accountability was often unclear. Technology &amp; Product often worked against, instead of with each other. Unclear team &amp; departmental level objectives.. Can't think of any cons. - toxic environment dominated by politics in the management layer - big egoes in the management layer - HR taking the side of the more powerful rather than acting as an impartial  - completely lack of transparency - company values are true only on paper. No or slow progression, low salary compared to some other companies. Lost it's niche! Getting too corporate.. None that you don't get in any job. Can get a bit hectic as there are so many people in one building. over worked, underpaid, very very slow progression lack of care in a pandemic stressful environment, blame culture, low morale in teams. Fast growing company that cant keep up with growth spurt. just a number, clicky, dead end job. Can be repetitive Atmosphere usually stressed. Not a huge room for progression unless people leave. Management deem you as difficult if you question there decisions. High volume and high pressured environment. Leadership could be a bit more transparent. Long hours, work life balance, blame culture. Micromanaging all over the place. Long hours, slow progression, work weekends  management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising. Management is very poor, doing everything by the book. You are always being watched, being told off even if you spend one minute extra on your toilet break. No room for promotion.. Bias agency  Hard work especially stock control Be aware of the women with ginger hair in pod 3 : NIGHTMARE. Salary ratio to Hours worked. lots of extra unpaid hours worked, hierarchy and treatment off management. I didn't get paid for my overtimes. Progression - there are 3 stages per role. 0 transparency toward the staff. Bad management  Un appreciative of staff. High likelihood of last minute team and department changes. Lack of females within the senior leadership teams.. Decision making is often questionable and you can feel frustrated.. too much work, too much fatigue, target very heavy to achieve. Communications need some improvement, lack of diversity in exec board &amp; leadership. the workload is very heavy - expect to work a lot more than contracted hours. only black guy in the team. Not enough comms from management, cliquey, not enough diversity.. - VERY hard to be promoted, needs to be the right timing, things change a lot. - depending on you're line manger, some people shouldn't be mangers.. Very fast paced and sometimes direction can change quickly. Treated like youre at school. - lack of communication - no clear company policy/entitlement rights. Salaries have slipped way below market. 1. No more good parties. Very top down communication. No incentive or encouragement to pursue passion projects/change. Little emphasis on sustainability. Pay is okay but no room for negotiation.. lack of progression low Pay. Low salary for London life. Its a typical big corporation in many ways- high turnover of staff and the training you receive upon starting is terrible.. Can be a tough Environment to work in with high expectations and long hours. Department lacked vision and leadership was lackluster. Outsourcing to poor external company caused more problems than it solved. Benefits increasingly reduced. Hamstrung by poor policies e.g. we would be punished if we attempted to refund a delivery charge (for a late delivery or in the case that an order wasn't delivered) unless the customer actively asked us to.. management , wage , hours , facilities. Progression within department is next to impossible. long work hours, normal pay. * Management are often quite late in sharing organisational changes * For the work that LSEs do, they deserve a little more compensation. Some Company benefits depend on department. Pair programming disaster, chaos environment, noise in the office, low salaries, no bonus, siloses of knowledge, architects living in their own world. Low salary compared to other businesses. Clear favouritism within the organisation and salary did not quite match with the workload. Working on womenswear - not such a good vibe Some people have big egos Teams work differently within a department. Very little progression, base salary is very low. Kids managing kids, poor leadership, more invested in making the work place look nice than how they treated staff. My impression of this company is that it is full of jerks. They're above average in the narcissism department, but I don't think that explains it entirely. I read in another review about islamophobia. I was also shocked by attitudes towards muslims during my very brief time at ASOS. Attitudes from some quite well paid people. I complained about it to HR. They told me I was lying. When I proved I wasn't they said they didn't care. It felt at times like working for an organised crime ring. I've worked for a lot of companies. I found this place horrid. And depressing. I don't think I've ever found going into work so depressing in my life.. Nepotism C suite arrogance Lack of innovation. Where do I even begin with this? We were overworked and underpaid, expected to work long hours (particularly on Monday when the systems would crash as you tried to do anything). If you left on time youd be on the receiving end of tuts and snarky comments.  There was absolutely no chance for progression. I made it clear during my interview that was what I was looking for in this job and was promised the world but what I found instead was tasks being dropped on you from a higher level under the guise of progression, only to receive no assistance and when you (inevitably) fail youd be blasted in front of the whole team. Youd also be expected to cover colleagues work when on holiday which on its own is not a unfair request but on multiple occasions I had to pick up a colleagues task they had left for days only to be told off and when I couldnt cover my workload, their workload, helping to train a new person and the task theyd just left prior to their holiday - somehow myself not being able to cover this was my issue and not the issue of the person on holiday.  This brings us to the biggest issue I found at ASOS the workplace bullying. I loathe to call someone this but my manager was nothing more than a bully protected by the managers above them. Once they had decided they had it out for me my time was done and I was bullied to the point of a mental breakdown, and pulled into a meeting where I felt I had no choice to quit or be fired. In a last ditch attempt I went to HR only to have them feed back to my bullys manager who in turn pulled me to one side and brought up the comments I had made. So much for confidentially. In the end I felt like I had to rescind my comments in my exit interview for fear of my reference being in danger.   Never been so happy to leave a job in my life.. nothing bad to say about it really. On your feet all shift. Poor management who are completely detached from the processes involved in entry level roles, lack of support for new employees, difficult to progress (very rigid promotion structure where you have to be in specific roles for a certain amount of time before being 'allowed' to be put forward for promotions), don't often have enough time in the day to make use of any of the perks, lots of staff are extremely unhappy and the retention rate within teams is low.. management , building , lowering the discount , making people redundant. People with a bit of power are arrogant, from other deparments as well, there are no team work at all and no chances to progress if you're a foreigner.. no personal life, extremely stressful, limited work life balance. Senior leadership rolling back benefits, terrible pay (despite increased profits) &amp; many senior team managers have no people leadership skills. Favouriting managers, poor level of management. Progression  salary increases Diversity needs to improve. Toxic, No room for progression, treated as a number, not respected, undervalued, overworked, cliche fashion environment</td>\n",

Easy to get the job even without experience in finance. Easy to get the job, Nice colleagues.. Good investment management strategy. Overall there are individual admin staff that are very nice and helpful. Free parking . Meet some nice people in the teams . Flexible hours . Benefits sickness death in service bonus if you employed for over 1 year .. I find AFH to be a caring employer, that is both adaptable to  employees' needs and prepared to listen to opinions.   Since I've worked at AFH there have been many progressive changes for the workforce in the way of employee benefits (for example, these include a savings scheme, discounted gym membership, annual company events and after-hours classes such as French and Pilates).   The office itself is a great working environment, with a friendly and open staff who make newcomers welcome.   There is ample free & secure staff parking available and the train/bus route is convenient. Staff inductions are always carried out and training needs are regularly monitored.   Progression through the company is encouraged and it's possible to change career paths internally if opportunities arise.. AFH is a great company to work for. The training courses available are brilliant, from Excel training to product knowledge, all courses are available to all staff. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming. The CEO always acknowledges you when he sees you, as do all management. We have annual staff events (summer events and christmas parties) which are a great way to mingle with staff from other levels of the office. There are a number of other pros for working for AFH such as: - discount at local gyms - Saving Schemes - family fun day bbqs - great atmosphere working the office - annual bonus - secure parking - payrise based on performance.. ...The list could go on!!  Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company.  We have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.  All in all I really enjoy working for AFH!. Big group of young people. There are opportunities to advance and progress in different directions. A great place to work with a really caring and great employer. Nothing! The whole package was completely  mis-sold. All sounded too good to be true and it was.. hours ok colleagues and line managers are really nice. Friendly people, almost like a family!. I joined AFH in December 2017 and have found them to be a truly great company to work for. On week one meetings were arranged for me with all the Senior Managers from the various departments so I could understand the different parts of the business.  There is a good positive atmosphere at AFH and you are actively encouraged to talk openly about any issues including with the CEO. The benefits package is good but just as important, you are made to feel valued and recognised for a job well done. I work with many teams across AFH and find them to be helpful and generous with their time.  Good work / life balance is also very much in evidence.. I jumped from a bankassurance world into the world of IFA and was very careful about selecting AFH as I interviewed with plenty of companies before choosing this one.  Everything they told me about themselves was true, as I found out later, and they put their money where their mouth is when they say they put clients first, which is incredibly refreshing after working for banks who say one thing and do another.  Everyone is happy to help and support you where they can, and I am left to do my own thing successfully and build my own business without micromanagement, which for me is crucial!   AFH look after their staff well,  and it's a pleasure to work for a company who you feel are working in the right way for their staff, themselves and their clients.. AFH really does pride itself on looking after it's clients and this is evident in the way it supports staff to progress with qualifications. Individuals who work for AFH get the opportunity to develop and progress if they put the work in.  Lovely office and very friendly staff.. The multiple Xmas & Summer events which the CEO's PAs spend their whole time organising.. Approachable staff Client focused Staff Benefits are increasing Great way to get your foot in the door Progression and movement is encouraged. A growing and profitable company. Flexible hours, compressed hours and part time working are all potentially available. Ability to buy and sell holidays. Reasonably diverse mix of employees at lower levels. Reasonable office facilities and friendly staff.. Working hours  Some of the people you work with My actual boss (not supervisor) was supportive and did try to make me feel more comfortable.. Great people in some places, excellent Christmas/Summer parties. Majority of the people there are lovely, and thats about the only pro. Nice environment, love people, not too stressful. -Great People -Heading in a good direction generally. Friendly, engaged, all staff members can be close to CEO with a 'family' environment. Friendly coworkers. Ready to help at any moment. Feels like a family.. Horrible experience working here. Would not recommend.. None, they lie about working hours, bonuses, projects and pay. There are none to speak of. Good company to work for   \n",

                     The operations staff are generally good people and hard workers. Next door to a pub... Trust me, you'll consider it to be a pro after a couple of weeks working here. Not much else.. The core staff, managers and above, have been there for 10 years or more. It means there is a stable environment to work in. Some recent investment has led to more opportunities in IT and operations.. Friendly colleagues.

Everyone genuinely wants to help each other.. \"Foot in the door\" as a junior staff member, to gain some experience before moving on elsewhere.

Good opportunity for progression, like many employers hard work is rewarded in the long run. Has handled the COVID situation remarkably well considering WFH was never an option for anyone below management previously as it was not believed it would be possible across the board, they have proven themselves wrong and adapted very quickly offering a lot of support and have not been afraid to provide the resource required to make it possible.. - Some ok people to work with in the team - the gym is useful onsite, if you're allowed time to use it. Great working atmosphere, lots of chance for progression. Great office and working environment, good on-site facilities, gym, roof terrace and large communal area. Well organised and well attended company events, Financial support for relevant professional qualifications.. I've been working at AJ Bell for over 15 years and during that time have worked in 5 different roles, progressing each time to the role I am in now. The business is at a scale now which means there is genuine opportunity to not only progress but also to diversify in terms of the direction of your career and also your skills.  There is a real family feel here and I feel genuinely valued as an employee. Having a young family myself and a full time job can be tricky to manage, but AJ Bell have been nothing but supportive to incorporate flexibility where possible. The on-site gym, pay day drinks and numerous opportunities to socialise with team mates are a real bonus to an already great business.. Great culture within the business towards staff and customers - really refreshing to work at a place like this.  Supportive - Management within my area have been amazing in support given for training, progression, workload and even personal life. They really care about you and not just hitting targets.

A strong sense of togetherness is seen across the business through a blend of social events and also numerous areas for social interaction within the office.. Great office space, friendly staff, great opportunities for progression!!. If you like working for a company that is sexist, where senior management dont care for staff and point the finger and blame others, then this is the company for you. If you want to progress, you either have to sleep with a senior manager, director or be married to them. If you want to complain, this wont be heard as cover ups as are frequent and dont they dont take it seriously. They have a conflict of interest as senior managers are married to directors, so they are all in a click. Nice building and metro link is on the doorstep..

There is opportunity to progress. good company to work for, nice office.. AJ Bell is an excellent company with a good pay scale and plenty of incentives.. If you're happy to accept an average salary and poor benefits to get your foot in the door of the Financial Services industry then AJ Bell is the place for you. The low bar for staff entry means you can get your first experience in Financial Services before moving on to a company that actually protects and values its staff. My advice to anyone looking to work at AJ Bell is to use it as a stepping stone in your career. Get the experience, and the name on your CV, then get out.. Nice offices and some nice people work there. Great people and culture, loads of opportunity for progression and development. Very supportive when serious illness affects you.. Great momentum after the company floated. One of the best employers in UK. Great employee benefits Good working atmosphere Flexible working. Lots of internal job openings once you understand the business and the products. No furlough during lockdown, secure industry Nice offices, on-site gym and payday drinks Friendly staff More flexible now, regular work from home Lots of training courses available and development programs. everyone is in the same boat so coworkers are easy to get along with. AJ Bell is one of the best organisations I have worked for. Its inclusive, friendly and very secure. Having moved from a more sales based organisation it is a breath of fresh air to not be KPI driven and particularly right now, to know that I am working in an very stable industry. I have been promoted since being here, put through formal qualifications and feel like a valued member of the AJ Bell team. The potential to work from home more in a post covid world is a big benefit for me. I'm excited for the future of my career.. Pay day drinks, Christmas/Summer party, virtual events during lockdown.. Company drinks, good Christmas / Summer do, nice people. Good work / life balance when volumes are lower.. Near to home, great people. Study package, friendly working environment.. Friendly team who are helpful and approachable. Good manager who will spare me time even when theyre really busy.   Good that you can take professional qualifications paid for by the company.  Some of the reviews on Glassdoor about AJ bell just do not reflect my experience of working here - Ive had good support from my manager and the HR team when Ive needed it.  I think AJ Bell has done a good job of looking after its staff during Covid.. Good social events and Christmas parties.. Good social events before Covid. Decent bonuses/ payrises.. Other colleagues and the odd manager. Colleagues are really friendly, social environment Lots of support from management and our CEO during the COVID situation, felt really comfortable and secure in my job Good benefits, such as decent holiday allowance, mental health support, pay day drinks and social/charity events Great office space, inc gym, dining area and roof terrace. Monthly payday drinks (on the last Friday of the month which isn't always payday) Summer & Winter parties Bi-Annual bonus scheme On site gym  From a social perspective, it is brilliant. Supportive environment - manager/team leader always around to help, listen to concerns and promoting development. Good social benefits - I've attended lots of social events throughout my time here & even through COVID we've held virtual cocktail classes & cooking sessions. Job security Nice modern office & great facilities Bi-annual bonuses Holidays are good & we have the option to buy or sell which helps with flexibility throughout the year. Alot of change, fast paced, friendly people, very busy, lots of growth!!. Lovely people, caring management, superb office (with gym and rooftop terrace!) and the best parties!. Employee share scheme Lots of social activities Modern office environment Good prospects for entry level jobs Mainly young workforce Growing business & lots of industry awards. Plenty of opportunity for career development. Average company to work for. The people are what makes going to work bearable. Most people are friendly and approachable, even some of the senior managers. There's are a few added extras that are good:  holiday allowance. Now starts at 24 and increases per full company year to a max of 30 I think.   free on-site gym. There isn't loads of equipment but there are classes morning lunch and after work.  (Obviously not open currently)  nice offices that are modern.   some fantastic colleagues that actually become friends.. - Will employ just about anyone - Somewhere to build experience in financial services for 1-2 years - Mostly harmless managers as long as you do your job - Decent social scene if you are young (pre-lockdown anyway) - Office building is ok I guess. The company does so much to ensure staff are engaged and the career opportunities are fantastic. Nice people, good atmosphere, lots of mobility in terms of working in different departments and areas of the business, opportunities to progress if you're willing to take feedback on board.. Learned a lot about AJ Bell products.. Offices are nice and spacious. Great fellow team members, who became a supportive family through the stressful and often downtrodden atmosphere   \n",
       "2  Generally very good life balance and hours. Fridays finish at 5 instead of 5.30 and for three months of the year you get to finish at 3pm and enjoy the summer. Last Friday of the month the company puts on free beers for staff. Also a good thing.  Generally a very good, close IT development department with many highly skilled and clever people pushing each other to expand their knowledge.  The company covers some really interesting technologies and there were opportunities to learn lots about emergent tech trends which could shape the site and various tech products in the company further. This \"give it a go\" attitude is something they should be proud of.  Fortnightly sample sales are good but over the years less good stuff was in them - I think the buyers themselves started to take anything they want home for themselves.. - Youthful staff - if you are in your 20s or 30s you'll be a good fit - Staff discount - it can save you a lot of money if buy lots of clothes - Colleagues - you can meet many decent people. Working day is 9-5pm, goes quickly and an opportunity to be somewhat creative. Looks good on cv  Great discount. good team and great culture in the company. staff discount and sample sale. All employees are treated well and respected at every level, great social environment, work-hard play-hard ethos. Despite having been around for 15 years, the atmosphere is young and vibrant and ASOS actively and successfully maintains its small-company feel.  As a technologist, working at such a huge scale is really rewarding. ASOS handles over 2 billion page hits per month and delivers more than a parcel a second to 240+ countries around the world, so the technology is vital to the success of the business.   Good people who are dedicated, motivated and work together.  Good benefits, 40% staff discount, sample sales  Summer hours - 3pm finish on Fridays from June-August! Friday beers and lots of other events.. Some really great people work for ASOS and some brilliant ideas are available to generally help improve the working environment. They want to be a family type business that looks after their employees, supported by excellent benefits.. Great culture, fast paced, creative environment, chance to get your ideas heard and to make a difference. good 40% discount and parties. got paid weekly most of the people where friendly and helpfull. Brand is super strong and customers and sales keep growing incredibly fast.  Great environment with lots of young people and friendly management.  Working in the Mobile team is a great experience as it is where all the company focus is now and the whole team is very skilled and motivated.. regular work for full time employees, free WiFi in canteen.. People are nice. Good work /life balance. One can do what you want.. Free tea and coffee Small selection of free fruit Ample parking. Good staff discount, work life balance and opportunity to work on new technologies in a good team.. Good discount, lots of little perks like 3pm finish in summer on Friday. Friendly casual environment. Sample Sales. Very good Christmas and summer parties (if you like that sort of thing). Great discount and laid back working environment.. Bonus, Good Benefits,Work hard play hard culture. Very flexible with regards to being able to release software in production environments with very little lead time required, therefore supports the agile framework of shipping software more frequently.. Office recently refurbished - fresh and buzzing lots of hip creative types friendly IT team Forward thinking Onside canteen, coffee shop free tea/coffee/milk/fruit Sample sales great onsite showers onsite fitness classes and lockers. The people.  The office is a beautiful layout. Lots of employee perks such as personal trainer, spa packages and employee sales.. Collaborative company where you feel truly cared about. I was so surprised when I joined ASOS at just how different the environment was to other places I'd worked. I already knew a few people that worked at ASOS and asked them what they thought of the company before I made my decision to join. The feedback from them was a resounding 'they really look after you' and that's exactly what I've experienced.  Opportunity to grow  quickly within the company, flexible hours and just trusting employees in general, good basic salary for the retail industry, great package, from flexi cash and bonus all the way to more niche things like bicycle scheme and holiday vouchers and having your birthday off work.  Amazing like-minded people who don't treat you as competition but as colleagues and friends, a company and brand to feel proud of, exciting things happening within the business and being able to feel proud of it.  Cool company feel and office space, awesome canteen, really buzzing and exciting atmosphere to be in.   Strong feeling that the Exec really care about the company which in return makes you really care. The CEO is in the office every day working like everyone else. He doesn't even have his own office, but sits in an open-plan amongst the rest of the employees.  The work ASOS are doing in CSR- the fact we have our own foundation and do tons of charity work is a massive plus for me. Working in a fashion company you can sometimes feel that what you're doing might not, in fact, 'really matter'. ASOS has such a focus on its charity work and every year sends its employees out to help build schools for homeless children in India, and wells in villages in Africa. They also encourage people to raise money all-year round, and are constantly organising fundraising events. It makes you feel really proud to be part of a company that focuses so much on doing good.. not to sign on at job centre. Sample sale.  Staff discount.  Summer Fridays.  Monthly Beers.  Really good people working in IT and the business!. Great company and great benefits. One of best places I worked in before certain appointments were made. Done great talent in middle and lower management.. Great company but it feels like its lost its sparkle in the last two years - its getting too corporate. Its a shame.. Great people  Exposure to senior management/board High growth business Innovation Excellent benefits Well remunerated Staff discount Ownership of ideas Constantly evolving. The office had a Relaxed atmosphere. Get to work with Friendly and interesting people. Good progression structure. Good parties! Great discount.. benefits are the best I have ever received. Flex bens allowance, pension etc and then the extras like the 40% discount, stall sample sales, summer hours, beauty rooms in house, fitness classes in the basement. I think staff  can sometimes take all that for granted.   social place.  Allows you to be individual and contribute ideas.   Informal work space and open environment - maybe not for everyone. Buy clothes at bargain prices.. I don't see any good reasons to work in the IT department. Asos creates a fun environment which is full of passionate people. Most people are really behind the great brand and the discount! the socials are great and the company has great ambitions. It provides a great culture for young first jobbers.. Rapidly growing organisation which is on the up, tech in particular is evolving and improving, good atmosphere, perks (staff discount!), good location..

much with progression, no incentive to work harder, high turnover of staff, poor systems. Very low salary, poor working conditions, very little training provided but high expectations. Micro management are young, inexperienced and superficial girls who are not able to provide guidance and support for their teams.. Abysmal pay, around minimum wage. No actual training for your job role. No incentive to improve. training. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth when the CEO drives a roll royce and the majority of the workers are payed so lowly. The management and seniors are ruthless. No training for staff. Staff are poorly paid and virtually no retention. The consultants have no communication and despite being a \"national\" firm they can't seem to understand anything beyond Bromsgrove.. Not treated at all well after 6 yrs of being a loyal hard working member of staff . This company just pushes you out and replaces you with someone who they think is right or someone who just agrees !  It's called constructive dismissal , note to self should of took this to court !   Not sure who owns the company as the CEO seems to let the operations manager run the place ! Which nobody has respects for !   HR do not trust at all they there to help employees but all they do is protect the company !   To much work , stressful , salary low , lack of experienced staff in admin !   I would not recommend AFH to anyone Employee of choice they call it funny it's definitely not !. I am unable to find any Cons for AFH Wealth Management.  This is a great company to work for.. I cannot think of any cons for working for AFH.. Abysmal pay. Try to get away with paying staff bare minimum. Really high staff turnover.. Sometimes you have to wash up your own cup !!. Lack of support to develop. The HR team is a shambles.. i worked at their AFH Insure division, give you leads that are impossible to work.  Training pretty much none existent. Desk managers cant help as they are expected to generate their own sales and struggle to help their team to improve the overall desk revenue.  Cold calling the same people over and over again even when told not to ring back.  I spent last week ring people over 70 if they want life insurance,  or reviewing old policies.  Cancel your current policy and then take out one with less cover for more money.. Progression is hard, almost feels like the supervisors/managers dont want progression sometimes.   Pay is too low. No cons to speak of. Nothing worth mentioning at all.. None I can think of.. Too many to list unfortunately. IMO and based on my experiences there: Unless this is your first job where you get some workplace experience, don't apply.  Extremely unethical practices Senior Leadership Team are mostly internally promoted therefore leave very little to be desired in terms of how to actually run a business. Toxic culture SLT like to talk about innovation or change but have no idea how to implement or probably even want to HR team are also incompetent and I personally was privy to numerous unethical practices when recruiting.. Salary for administration staff needs to be looked into. (Extra 2-4k a year to match other companies will improve statistics). Autocratic, very much a my way or the highway organisation. Quality control an issue, with an emphasis on volume rather than quality. Largely ineffective middle management. Training and upskilling are low priorities. Some job insecurity, the company can be quite ruthless when managing out people.. Supervisor made me very uneasy from the start never introduced me to the rest of the team, not a people person and wasnt approachable. was not supportive and expects you to know exactly what youre doing even if you have never been in that sector before.. Poor pay, huge gap for pay between senior management vs those who support them, managers who bully yet you are the one driven away, lack of flexibility. Salaries are much lower than market competitors and there is no standard salary ladder, they just pay each individual person whatever they can get away with. Most of management is shocking and know nothing about how the company/processes work - or how to manage a team, young girls just go for the promotion for the higher pay but are not capable of doing any management role There is no progression at all. Management can be clicky at times. -Low Salary -Middle Management likes to micro Manage  -Staff Retention in Investment Admin team very low. Views itself as a boutique, not able to break out of a mould. IT accessories are old and cheap - monitors, mouse, etc.. Awful management  Micro management Only care about numbers and money not the happiness of their staff Happy to go against government guidelines and risk the health and safety of staff members to prematurely make staff go into the office even though people were t pleased with it- when I told them I was unhappy with the 6 days notice they terminated my contract with immediate effect for this reason  They dont care about their staff at all and if you raise an concerns or voice your own opinion they will get rid of you with no valid reason and will not follow any procedure.. -Unachievable bonus unfairly set by manager -bullying -MICROMANAGEMENT  -long hours  -no sympathy to people who travel or have children  -Manager is extremely rude and condescending -High staff turnover  -Mistreatment of staff -False promises -Lied to about job role-it was cold calling  -If you challenge management you are fired without warning or proper procedures -Do not follow covid guidelines -Poor response from hr and manager as a whole  -Insufficient workload but then have the cheek to ask you what you're doing. Borderline bullying, nepotism, overworked - steer clear. Communication between departments is lacking   \n",

                  Regular issues with the various computer systems, sometimes creates a perfect storm in which next to no work can be achieved. Almost non-existant progression ladder. Experience and hard work generally remains unacknowledged by management. Equally, industry qualifications seem to count for nothing. Low pay compared to similar positions in other companies. Lack of communication between management and the staff.. As managers have been there for 10 years or more, the opportunities to move up are few and far between. Like a lot of companies, directors have their favourites who will move up regardless of experience or talent.. Salary was very basic. I felt that for the pressure and amount of work, the salary elsewhere is much higher and a lot more competitive.. Will only progress if you know the right people. HR department are not worthy of being the \"go to\" for staff members as they are not trusted and underhand/biased promotions. No flexibility with hours. Hire too many \"kids\" so they can pay cheap wages - and therefore no-one gets treated like an adult or trusted. If you're not liked by the right people you're bullied out.. Not very strong work ethics especially on the team I worked, People should take a more positive approach to work and not just \"do the job\". Hard performers are neither recognised nor rewarded, not very good basic pay and enormous amount of workload within an understaffed team that's main focus should be clients.. Underpaid therefore experienced staff leave making the role harder to do. The company  should increase wages and give people incentives to stay.. Managers just give mates a job, absolutely no prospects and they will regret letting all the experienced staff leave because they are doing. Management are detached  Monotonous Ambition is frowned upon Progression impossible. Poor salary. Support to progress is non existent. There is a huge 'Face fits' culture. Poor operating systems. Training is lacking.. Parking can be an issue and there could be more social engagements available.. Very poor management and lack basic understanding of diversity.. Communication in certain situations & could have higher pension contribution from the company.. Parking is an issue around Tunbridge Wells but there is ample non-resident street parking around the town and some on-site parking available to staff and easy access to rail links.. - Current building is slightly dated however we are moving to a brand new location early this year which has great new facilities including a gym and social areas.. Current office slightly dated, but with a move to a new office space in a few months, nothing to worry about.. Parking is an issue, and the building is outdated however the move to EQ4 early this year will go some way to addressing these.. Current building is very shabby, but we're moving soon. Sometimes it feels like your asked for an opinion on something even though the decision is already made. Can take a while to replace people, suspect down to recruitment policies (see 'pros' list). Pension offering not great in current market. Parking is limited but with the new site move this should hopefully be resolved.. Nature of business doesn't allow true flexible working. Benefits (e.g. pension) package not as competitive as it could be for sector. Very busy, not making full use of all facilities, but this will change as the team develops. They don't give people a fair chance, the basic HR system of aptitude tests doesn't work when it comes to employing new people or promoting those at junior levels. systems need a lot of work. None - only reason I left was they closed the Tunbridge Wells office. Very different cultures between Manchester & London offices, which are not always to the benefit of the company.  The company is so driven to remain at the bleeding edge of the industry, that it ignores what it already has.  Embarrassingly poor benefits package.  Customer service could be better - you get what you pay for.. Lower than average pension contribution.  Low holiday allowance (but increases with service and buy holiday scheme).. Terrible upper management who dump things on you Promotions are very biased within the company, interviews are more for show when going for a promotion as the decision is likely to have already been made. Boring work, low pay, hard to progress, poor culture, role was not as advertised. Large turnover of staff lower paid roles. Low pay & small bonuses Repetitive work Every promotion is highly competitive Some teams are managed worse than others Customer service clients are not nice to deal with Only 22 days holidays. Poor company pension - for a pension company! Astonishing staff turnover.   Few opportunities to move up the ladder, no matter what skills you have. Would rather cut corners than fix source of problems or deal with systemic issues.. Salary, although advertised as competitive, often falls short of the mark when compared to market competitors which can create a level of dissatisfaction within the workforce. Pay progression is also slow with little clarity on how to move up the pay scale. This is not helped by emails often sent by the board advertising how profitable the company is continuing to be. Despite being a relatively young company some of the views and attitudes held higher in the company can sometimes be a little Dickensian with regards to feedback and criticism.. - Soul-less working environment - Inconvenient place to work (no parking facilities and difficult to get to) - Opportunities for social or charity work only goes to management or C-level - Out-dated Working From Home policy - No trust of staff from Management and above - Promotions given based on longevity, rather than skill / experience - What they say and what they do are different  In my view, I have seen all of these things, although some apply to how other members of staff were treated, not me.. Pay falls very short of the market rate, progression is encouraged and easy if you work hard however wages barely increase.. Due to location parking can be difficult for those without a company space, although public transport links nearby are very good.. None at all from my perspective. I have no real cons about the place. What I have found is that where an issue is raised the business listen and try to react. Also, the business proactively look for concerns with an annual survey as well as ongoing communication.. Pension Contribution % is a bit low. pension contribution could be a little higher but all the benefits offered outweigh this.. Company benefits slightly worse than other places I have worked. The salary could be better when comparing it to other similar job roles. - low pension contribution - slightly lower pay than other companies. Whilst the location of the office is in an up and coming area of Manchester that is being heavily developed it can be difficult for some to access via public transport, in particular by train. A large portion of staff do however get access to free onsite parking.. None , , , ,. Low pay Low pension contributions. Car parking a joke, as its a lottery system. Culture is a big thing with The company, but in reality, it has a culture of sexism (unless you sleep with one of the managers) , bullying, finger pointing, cover ups and drinking. Might be worth the staff being breathalysed on payday Friday drinks, as staff are encouraged to drink to excess and drive home. Systems are a joke, constant IT failures, penalised by management on your bonus for not hitting your target. Management use sick pay as a weapon as to whether your face fits. HR are a joke, they dont care about your mental health, but boast on social media that they have mental health coffee morning chats available for staff, this is far from the truth as this never happens. They claim that they support the LGBTQ+ community, but in truth, the pride parade is no more than a publicity and promotional event. The toilets are unhygienic and stink. Unhygienic kitchen. So glad Im working from home at the moment. Senior management walk about the department in a bid to appear visible but they dont acknowledge you or talk to you. Its more like a power trip. None that I can think of. there are no cons currently. Salary is on the lower end of the spectrum.. Salary wise not much productive. Nothing much is negative to say. -Pension contributions -Cant think of anything else!. Pathological command and control culture. Managers completely detached from reality.  Aggressive senior member of staff using obscene language at daily stand up to describe other staff members and teams.  Manager behaving in misogynistic fashion making inappropriate comments to female members of staff and ignoring toxic behaviour within the team.  Passive aggressive HR department \"We use a Bradford scoring system, so don't ever get sick\". Bombarding everyone with pointless, endless mandatory training courses.  Ancient tech stack, rotten code base, irrational resistance to refactoring, changing or upgrading existing code.. Doesn't pay enough money etc. The training isnt always provided. started to become like a call centre. Its like a school playground. Very cliquey, unbelievably toxic environment, with harmful rumours spread and spiteful comments made if youre not part of the in crowd.. First the minor points: - Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business. - Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business - The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short. - Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.  The major failings: - HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go. - Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so theres almost a fear of being ill. - Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports. - Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But theyre seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture. - Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved.. Awful cronyism in middle to higher management. If you look the part and suck up to the right people then you can go far.. Pension contributions from employer are embarrassing. No pay rises during a year of record profits.. Poor salary, no freedom to express yourself. Wage i think is too low. Feel like one of many Underpaid to a degree. Pension contribution should be higher Bonus not the biggest Salary on the lower side for some roles Parking used to be a problem but not during lockdown. Under staffed, poorly managed, undelivered promises. You can call this AJ Hell. Pension contribution is lower than my previous employer, but the holidays and job security outweigh that.. No consideration to the staff, customer and sla is more important than any illness or mental health issue that you have, low pay for high stress job, compulsory overtime when busy, difficult to progress. Salary The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.  Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.  Management  Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed.   Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isnt which is lying to upper management.   Culture  Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams arent run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.  Promotions  Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit.   IT systems  The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close calls so it appears as though your issues are resolved.  Overall:  Good place to start your career or use as a stepping stone to advance your career.. Pay is not enough, too much work. Job stability, unpaid overtime and low bonus.. For me, not much. I would like to be paid more (who wouldnt)  but theres still good training and study opportunities.    Theres not much to the social side at the moment for obvious reasons but its good to see online events happening like cocktail making.  Theres also access to online exercise classes and PTs while the gym isnt open.. Where do we start?  After being offered the job you realise quickly youve been given a position in the  overworked scapegoat department.   Pay variance- its massive between us some admins. Although its top secret, you are not suppose to discuss what you get paid. If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if youre promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage.   You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued.   Never go against the gain- youll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime.   Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot!   Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they dont care!   Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.  MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.    Overtime- you wont get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here!   Dont appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. Im sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope.   Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like thats what your aspirations in life are!   Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.  IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk!   Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santas (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.  Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion.   HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. Its basically do as I say not as I do.. Overworked, underpaid.   Bad management.   Staff burnout because understaffing, compulsory overtime and too much business.   Cant get staff quick enough for how many people leave so pull people over from other teams.   No concern for mental health or wellbeing unless they can write a blog about it to share on the intranet or publicly.   BARELY following Government Guidelines for COVID in comparison to other corporate companies.   HR act like they are on your side but are just there to find loopholes to make your issue your problems and not AJ Bells  Managers and TLs do not listen to their staff when offered suggestions to lighten the work load.. Senior management, planning, systems, HR, pay gaps, bullying. As such a large company, it can be hard to get to know people outside of your team. Low pay for the work that is carried out Overworked staff Limited growth opportunities Management don't seem to listen to the needs of their employees. Pay could be better and the pension contribution is a little low. Some systems and processes are still developing to back up the rapid growth. Progression can be challenging within the admin departments. Salaries below external market rates Employee benefits need improvement e.g. employer pension contributions Limited opportunities for experienced people Micro management work culture No flexi-time working available Statutory minimum annual leave. Benefits package is below standard. Progression. Yes you can progress if your face fits and you don't disagree with a decision from the top. They have a habit of promoting some shockingly bad people to managers just because their face fits, never mind if they can actually do the role. It's not the case in all departments but just the majority especially customer services.  People have been told outright not to apply for promotions as they want external candidates but then hire someone internal the week after.   A fair go. The company currently utilises the government levy for apprenticeships and this includes team leader and management courses. To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.    lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug.   bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses arent assessed fairly and they vary department by department.   poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking.   Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied.   All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places.. - Piss-poor salaries. Clearly taking advantage of young workers who don't know better. No payrises across the board in a year with record profits, record client growth and record shareholder dividends. - Management is stubborn does not welcome creativity or new ideas - everyth - Insufficient resources to get jobs done within service level agreements. Approving budgets to increase headcount takes place at a glacial place by which point teams are already way behind. Place seems to be run by stingy bean counters who don't recognise that explosive client growth is going to require similar increases in headcount. - Management does not listen to valid concerns of employees and prefers to shut down viewpoints of employees who go off-script - Few opportunities for meaningful progression unless you are willing to brown-nose your way to the top - Long hours (8.45 - 5.15, why can't it just be a 9-5?). There used to be limited parking spaces for staff but this has changed with the move to more home working. Poor pay, poor pension matching considering pensions are a large part of the business, many departments are understaffed and there is pressure on individuals to cover the shortfall rather than giving teams the extra manpower they need.. Awful company to work for. Pay and opportunities are rubbish. - AJ Bell like to hire youngsters fresh out of uni or from their first job at a shoe shop with no financial experience. This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with. - AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated. - It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them & make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave. - The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away. - Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management).   \n",
       "2  For a company where it's shop window and everything behind it relies totally on IT, the directors seem to know soo little about IT and as a result have gone through a chain of hiring sociopath to sociopath to be in charge of large parts of or all of IT over the years. They want a new, interesting company like ASOS to be linked to their career and use big names of other (often much more stuffy) business to get in through the door, then pull the IT department back into the 20th century.   The worst one was a recent CIO hire who started with a statement of intent of who they are and what they want to and don't want to do. Very quickly each of these promises was broken. Even worse, heads under them were replaced by people they had worked with in every company from the past 6-10 years of their career. These people were not brought in on merit. The result was a very strong cult of personality driving people out of the company, a swelling contract budget (more mates brought in) and importantly very little credible, long term value to the business. Having worked at the company for a long time it made me sick to see such a sought after and popular company get taken in by these people.  Not unusual I know but HR really are the pits, smiling assassins but dressed up to the nines.. - Management - they had no idea what they were doing - it was a real mess and they didn't listen - Career development - the performance review process is really bad and not based on merit. Also, you can expect to be boxed into a job and not being allowed to get involved in anything else at all - Technology - messy, old, things barely work and frequently break. Tense atmosphere, newcomers are more or less ignored and not showed around properly. Far too much work to get through in one day, with low freelance rates - you're expected to work like a machine, and made to feel inadequate if there is a mistake. People seem uninterested, fake and cliquey.. Unfriendly colleagues - cliquey atmosphere Disorganised chaos of clothing in the buying department - barely enough space to get desk Managers are too wrapped up in themselves with no real idea of what is going on in their team. begins to be more corporate and more difficult to interact. bureaucracy, hierarchy, low salary, NO DIRECTION, politics, inefficiency, hr department disastrous. Some of the internal systems are frustrating to use, often required to work long hours but rewarded for hard work in other ways and always appreciated!. No BYOD policy.   Still some cumbersome systems and processes in place but getting better all the time.   It's in a listed building so the plumbing can be a bit flaky and getting a lift to the 6th floor can be a long business.. So much is going on it's a struggle for team and programmes to keep track and on top of things. Changing direction quickly and context switching is hard. IT is seen as a burden on the business.. Rapid change is great but it's hard for the resources and systems to keep ahead of what's needed. Cattiness, lots of clueless middle management. if no work got sent home or not to come in and did not get paid for this if you had any holidays you had to use them to make your pay up. As any business growing very fast there are some challenges to deal with such as not very helpful processes or some legacy technologies to improve. you may have to walk 10 miles in a shift, power hungry lower management, very high temperatures in summer 30 degrees+ , no allowed to settle in one environment constantly moved around to where workers required either receiving,put away,returns,hygiene,pick, pack, dispatch etc each with its own kpi that you have to achieve or face a disciplinary even if you have an accident you face a full investigation, alcohol and drug tests then another disciplinary, if you have time off due to genuine sickness they do not believe you and you face the occupational safety nurse to find out what you can do! If you suffer from asthma or any other lung/respiratory complaint don't bother as the dust and heat will put you in hospital.Poor Health and Safety every week there is a new regulation that you have to adhere to now we have to ware glove's for all \"dangerous\" conditions.The local doctors have two common ailments the ASOS cough (caused by the dust0 and the ASOS bad back (caused by the heavy work). Not that I can't do it I'm an ex miner but it is punishing running up and down five flights of stairs constantly!!. People have the \"I don't really care \" attitude to work No training whatsoever Outdated tools Cold office Salaries rises are given based on favouritism. One may get thousands the other pity pennies.(fact) Middle management has no management skills No room for progression Full of people bored who can't really bother hence nothing ever gets done Rules are not same for all Performance at work is an utter joke. One may get an above and beyond by doing little, though that doesn't translate into more money so why should one bother?. No real career progression and you sense the company prefers employees with no ambition so they don't complain about the poor pay and lack of opportunities. Staff are treated much like children.. Too many layers of middle management that don't fully understand what the team they are managing actually does.. Although they have some good ideas for their website and offer hundreds of products, undercover IT is a mess and at risk of falling apart. The culture is very immature and you are more likely to get on well if you stand outside the office smoking or go drinking lots.  there is  a real lack of structure and process which means they do things quickly but end up doing it twice or doing it wrong because there's a lack of clear strategic planning. the top guys are well though of, the bottom rung work hard, but those in the middle - no one seems to know what they are doing. There's a big bullying culture here. And you need to be very thick skinned to survive. There's a very high turnover for a reason. people leave without even having jobs to go to, just to get out. ASOS wants to keep the young start up mentality, but they really could benefit from growing up a little.. Progression and development.  Impossible processes & systems.. Team/Department Politics, Lack of knowledge sharing across domains. The environment in the IT department seems to be that anything goes with regards to how things get done - resources poached from other teams to help get things done, last minute releases/fixes etc. Canteen really expensive Coffee shop should be subsidised. Senior management was a real challenge to engage with.  They need to do more to integrate sustainability into their core business model.. Can sometimes feel like there is so much we want to do and talk about doing, yet don't physically have the time to do it because of how fast-paced the environment is. I guess that's just down to prioritising workload.. This is my experience. If your pay is wrong there is little comeback. As regards flex hours you may be expected to begin shift two hours early at a moments notice and in spite of accumulating hours many employees' were asked to pay back hours! Ironically some were told to give back a week in overtime despite never being involved in any flex. When questioned HR would say they had access to information unavailable to Team Leaders rendering the Team Leader function a tad pointless. I feel HR didnt have control of the hours since being taken over twice. Oh and the handscanners are faulty so even though you can arrive in the car park 15mins early, by the time you use the clock in system inside it can reset and then go past the time expected in by a few seconds. Then the company charge you 15mins of pay for lateness. Targets are so high you can only achieve them by nearly breaking your neck, and if you have an accident you jeapordise employment. Good employees are treated like something on the bottom of your shoe, the lazy ones do well amazingly. Shift Managers waltz around like the second coming but I had no respect for the ones on despatch pick or pack. A Team Leader on Nights was the only one I respected but he's gone. Shame as now he has gone we have no one who takes us seriously, or treats us with dignity. Poor employer to work for.. Middle management politics! Too many contractors in IT for a very long time. Too many people trying to protect their own programs instead of looking at the bigger picture.  PMO could be utilise a lot more. Less politics and more direction leaders is needed.. CTO has issues. Either your part of his inner circle or he has no time for you. He knows best. Breaks the rules according to what suits him ( some very unethical ones) .Everyone else seems scared to disagree. Lost a lot of good people and will keep losing at this rate. Very political environment and rather cut throat. To survive basically dont challenge and query.. Too many Heads of Dept and too many getting promoted for who they know not what they know. Feels like you need to be a member of the good old boys club to further your career.. High growth business Constant pressure Changing properties. Cost and time of commuting. Systems can make work a bit manual and frustrating. Communication from management could be improved. some silly behaviors - immaturity at management level but think they need some training in how to deal with certain situations.. Open plan offices are too noisy.. Amazingly immature management. Whole IT team has talent in playing blamegames. Unethical behvaiour. Has a lack of direction, the company has many good ideas but due to high turnover at the top the plan is constantly changing. This can be frustrating for those wanting to see projects through to the end. It also means that you will work long hours. Whilst there are some great people there is also a lot of politics at the top.. The fact that its rapidly growing and evolving means it's a fast paced environment which may not suit everyone.. You're expected to put in very long hours and be on call 24/7.  The senior teams are very particular about who they favour and if you're not one of them, then you wont progress.  Other people in the business would go behind your back if it means they can get ahead.   Promotions are not based on value add to the business or quality of work. Flirting is seen as an acceptable way to win promotion.. I worked in the Customer Care team in London which was consisting out of 12-15 people from 5 different countries. We were the special advisors. My country team consisted of 3 people. One colleague was always listened to but us other 2 we were treated very special-. Throughout the whole team information was given only to the people who were good with the manager. we had 2 swaps within one year- the first leader really convinced me to speak about  if i would have a problem with my colleague. i said no cause I think these things need to resolve themselves -but he asked me in every one to one about it so that i thought he is interested and then I said what i do not like. Then the whole thing started. it broke up our team- instead of resolving it was always belived this one apparently only one knowledgeable member of the team and I feel betrayed for having said anything. Kept quiet went on working, Teamleader swap - became worse- the whole situation evolved again and that special person in our team got attention and everything and even in meetings with i higher perosn from the department the problem was not solved! It intoxicated my whole last months at ASOS becuase u felt like 2nd class people. Also in my reviews silly excuses were found that I do not reach the WELL DONE you need in order to be acknowledged or move to a different department whcih was my goal. I was not well done because I did a gap between a hiven and a capital letter and stuff like like this . I was always punctual or even over punctual at ASOS but even that meant nothing. The special person could be late 4 times a week ( yes we started counting and noted stuff) and they had always more cigarette breaks than others. Even behaving acc to the rules the next comment in my review was: You are better but still not welll done. No comment why on how instead poking on being sick one day! Was really not fair- felt useless with my colleague after a while and why they need us if the other person is so GREAT! This person btw was reluctant to show us stuff and always with a sigh and when I complained about it.they made a fuss ! Sorry for all these comments but I had a hell of 8 months there ( 3 were ok) and I seeked help but there was no support. and I want to make clear that this happened for Customer Care Specialists only! I love ASOS and what they offer to their employees really- by far the best I have seen. I left with a helpless sad and positive eye! I did not really want to leave but I needed to get out it affected my personal life and confidence.. can be all consuming...manage your time well and you will get the rewards. - Politics at senior management level - IT Changes are sometimes rushed through without proper testing - Turnover in I.T., there are some really good people who left. - Some teams/people can be quite clicky. team building activities could help with that.. Feedback not accurate Consistently criticised and not praised for what is done right Just a head's up, they will say \"can we have a chat?\" Take you off the floor for a couple minutes in front of everyone then tell you you're fired and have someone collect your things and literally show you the door. Happend to 20 people in the same day from different teams. The job is not secure considering most people who were being \"let go\" were only there for 1 or 2 months. Even being 1 minute late 3 times can cause you to be fired. You've been warned.. - not global thinking enough sometimes - sometimes fun comes before business! - workload is mad not giving you much time to think or be strategic on occassions. catty, negative towards assistant levels, a lot of overtime, lazy assistant buyers. - There's not enough space - desks are small and meeting rooms are always booked out - Things change...A LOT. I wouldn't recommend ASOS to someone who is not flexible or someone who doesn't like change - It can get very intense, it's busy all the time but mainly because people are really passionate about what they do. If you are a beginner in Customer Care rules are very strict. - Political - Unprofessional - Infantile - Arrogant - Treacherous. kpi is too high,no union on site,management don,t care about you,threat you like a slave,it is too long the list ,so if you can avoid this companny,they don,t care if you go or stay,you are only a number for them,. Over worked and under paid. Expected to work 12 hour days without  recognition or reward. I faced bullying from my manager, who made my life a misery by constantly putting me down and funnelling  her stress onto me and basically made my life hell. I reported her to HR but they didn't resolve anything.  Basically.. if you get on with your manger and he/she gets on with their manger you will be fine. if not you will have a tough time.. Upper Management and the way decisions are taken could lead to disappointment. Busy supervisors could/should be more present for their subordinates Long hours. overstaffed, weak members of staff. Poor middle management Inexperienced Team Leaders with poor micro-management skills Promotions based on popularity contests Treated like children. the whole place, from the top down all management have a bullying mentality and will get rid of you one way or another, they say there's no do's and don't's but done believe it! thats all the whole place is, questioned if you go to the toilet or make a drink, told off for being too productive, can never get holiday, all the bad reviews are true and the good ones are from people whose faces fit or have rose tinted glasses on, the latest news reports about the warehouse are true dispite being denied by executives! customer care is exactly the same and people need to see what asos are really like and how they treat their staff!. No career progression is possible. Cannot think of any at the moment. Company is growing very fast, you will need to keep up with everything.. Bad press which is a shame as the company seems to want the best for all it's employees and if there is a problem there are plenty of people that would love to get involved to change that.. Some areas still need a bit of improvement - such as in the QA leadership and some areas of the PMO. However I believe these are being addressed. if your face fits you'll be fine.. Chaos chaos chaos...everything happening very very and too fast. People that are more then 5 years there are marked and usually do not do much...except hiding knowledge to keep the status and being untouchable.. Terrible management. Low pay. HR doesn't care about employees hence the massive turnover at ASOS.. - Salaries aren't great - Big pushes to improve systems don't address underlying problems - Mostly a chaotic ride - Massive turnover of the best people - Layers and layers of tech debt (bad SQL, bad VB, countless architecture re-starts).. - not enough flexibility on dates of holidays - if you live in London, the commute is tiring  - you don't have your own desk. No progression - Colleagues allowed to get away with not working to standard. Inconsistent management, cliquey and often juvenile peers, lack of structure, and the HR team make far too many mistakes without ever fully resolving. Shift work, with a strong emphasis on conflicting early/late patterns.. - Maturity - Efficiency - Nothing else I can see. Wouldn't suit you if you don't like change and a fast pace. It's hard to move up the ladder. Compulsory 1 year needed in your role before you can move departments, even if you're skilled.. development is a little slow as it's a very set structure. Long hours!. Honestly i cannot think of any cons to working for ASOS that i have had even under the most stressful of times such as the site being down everything is handled amazingly and there is no real blame just learning experiences.. There's not quite enough space for all the new people but they're working on it. Also, sometimes being a big company makes it hard to get things done as quickly as they could be.. Useless and incompetent HR, no room for internal promotions, overstaffed, hot packed office, lots of politics, poor working conditions, too much lying.. Slow progress within the company. No real management support.. Questionable appointments to team leader roles, to say the least. This side of the company was expanding fast, so I can appreciate the need to fill the roles quickly, but it really was a case of whoever applied for such a role were either given it or asked to fill the role in probation form. It's great that they tried to promote from within, but some of the people were just not suitable for managerial type roles. It's as simple as that. Also towards the end of my time, they began to start taking privileges away from staff, in the name of efficiency. Not the way to motivate your staff or get them on side.. Slow Progression, but you do get there eventually The pay can be quite low. The workload can be very stressful. Stressful  Workload  Wage lower than work put in. - management - have to be a member of the 'old boys club' to get promoted. It's not the easiest place to work. It can be frustrating  at times and the turnover of staff is high.. 8 emails per hour target isn't always achievable - you can get a disciplinary for repeatedly having a low email average over shifts.   Progression can get political; managers know who they want to help.. Oppressive work environment. Unrealistic targets. Constant monitoring. Having to walk excessive distances of over 8 miles a day.  Not enough water stations. Timed toilet breaks.. Big company with lots or red tape and politics, mismanagement within team, hard to progress, favoritism, work can be monotonous at times.. - The job gets very repetitive  - Shift work. It's bad because the team is so young and not enough experience.. Working in Tech from a management/employee perspective is awful. There are a handful of really good managers who care about their staff. However, the others are simply greasy pole climbers who want to dine at the CEO's table and will do what it takes to get there.   There is no clear direction regards where is Tech is going. A likeable CIO has been unluky to have inherited a group of children to guide him. Am not going to mention names but avoid and Enterprise Architecture like the plague as it has caused more problems than solutions and if you want to commit career suicide, join Service Operations. A truly rank function that wouldn't know its backside from its elbow.. Huge Building so can get lost and IT Support can be delayed due to size of company but not really a 'con' - shows how well the company are doing !. extremely boring and stressful job bad management experience. Dispite the rules and processes Management use the egos to make up different one and contradict each other. Underqaulified and lazy Mangers some mangers are too scared to pick up the phone to call customers regarding their complainants and adviors have to do it. Managerment will shout and talk down to adviors.  A lot of offices politics. Staff can be very Cliqy as every one knows each other and some have generations of the family working there.  The old office was very dirty. You have to sale you sole to progress and for some that still isn't enough. You will be promoted for exerimental processes then demoted.. management to ridge, way to much inter office politics. Pay could be a lot better.. Myself and several others I know, have had a terrible experience with bullying here! The name calling, nasty remarks, rumours and career progression sabotage doesn't just stop with other customer advisors, some of the team leaders and senior staff also enjoy getting involved! During my ordeal here, I suffered with workplace depression, this was just labelled as attention seeking or drama. If I, or others tried to confide in management about the bullying it would just result in victim blaming and you'd be seen as the problem! An older team leader would often send inappropriate messages to young advisors, I too received these and was later pestered for a date. I was treated badly and humiliated here right up to the end of my last day. It really was awful! After leaving, I needed counselling for depression and anxiety. I am still affected by the experience now. I have heard from remaining employees that the bullies have found new victims and so it continues.. Sometimes stressful,  very often short handed. - The company is massively expanding so there are some building works going on at the moment. Expected to work very long hours. My team wasn't very well managed and failing badly which resulted in a bad atmosphere and limited support. being managed like a child - although a lot of are young.. Some staff very careless due to trying to hit high targets.. Not always room for career progression it can take a while to progress to next level.  Flexi time isn't really flexi time as it has to be agreed in advance. - becomes more and more corporate - new management coming in is attempting to turn it into M&S - no chance for internal career progression. No progression. Need to be popular have things. High turn over. Salary is not great, although it's adequate if we consider the benefits. Sometimes there are a lot of bureaucracies and a bit of disparity between teams in the technology department. Deadlines are sometimes not realistic and quality can suffer because of that.. - Rapidly expanding company so culture shift is happening, but that means more responsibility on people to self manage themselves and their careers (so not really a con but still watch out) - Not much governance and processes in place so larger projects tend to be frustrating to work on. At the moment there is quite a bit of building works on the office to cater for the expanding workforce, so it maybe noisy at times.. - Not as agile as it could be, although continuously improving on that front. - Teams still lack autonomy.. Takes forever to progress, workload can be really intense, low pay. You are expected to work well beyond your contracted hours and made to feel bad if you leave work on time- I was asked on several occasions so come in on the weekend to work for no extra money/time in lieu!! It is extremely fast paced and as the company is 24/7, you are expected to work non-stop without any flexibility. The pay generally is also very poor considering the size of the company and competitors out there. Recruitment process was also poor- people got hired because of WHO they know, not how good or qualified they are.. Have to switch shifts all the time, sometimes working until 11. Constant monitoring, system is like school. The targets they set are unrealistic, you should do a certain amount of emails/live chats/social an hour and it just isn't possible some days. One to ones you have every week with your team leader are very hard - if you make one mistake you are made to feel guilty about it and as if you are failing every aspect in life - almost a bullying tactic. The company offer no support if you are struggling or having problems outside of work. Team leaders would go missing for hours on end and therefore my team had no one to help us except the odd team leader you could find.  Most team leaders didn't have a clue about half of the policies and I feel that does not set a good example at all for new people. One last thing is keep an eye on what you say to anyone there, there are always people higher up than you watching you and monitoring you. Never discuss anything personal with your team leader or share any opinions on anything with them, they claim your conversations with them are \"confidential\" and make you feel like you're their friend, they're not. They write down everything you say and relay it all back to their management, even private things - which a company is not strictly allowed to do. All in all - would avoid working for this company.. Turnover is really high in tech, company losing great people constantly. Service ops full of corporate climbers, doesnt represent the company or brand at all. Young people wanting to move to other areas of the business or have left in general. Politics and clique groups. Where do I start? BULLYING, this place is a playground for sociopathic morons who if they see you as a threat will 'investigate' you for stirring your coffee too  many times. They will dumb you down, you can't use 'big' words their banned because they don't understand them. They treat you like rats in cages; they have colour codes for your productivity- it will start reasonable; 3 an hour and then it will get ridiculous; 10+ customers so that's live chats, emails, social the works you'll be expected to diagnose, read through the chain and notes in 2 minutes with a cherry on top, they also monitor your 'quality' so expect to complete the feats of a robot for 11000 a month after tax. They lure you in with a 700 pound bonus if you pass probation, but the jokes on you because you only get  it  6 months after passing probation! This company will have you jumping through hoop after hoop and will exploit your desire to do well. You're under constant surveillance; expect  a battleaxe to be walking around sniffing out for a DPA  breach which is just being on your phone around the computers. Once you pass your probation though you can work from home? If they let you go you will be humiliated and escorted out of the building by security.. Do not support mental health HR do not support you Some teams are very clique and use bully tactics No one to speak to when in trouble Do not train you properly if at trainee level. This is a cliquey place and cliques are kings. From day one you will understand, if the clique accepts you, and then they will set the pace for you. You won't have much choice, you will eventually succumb to what the clique dictates. If the clique doesn't like you, the backstabbing will start almost immediately and it will be ferocious and merciless. You will find no friendly soul, no person to confess your thoughts, no friend. Everybody 100% will do their best to bring you down to your knees. If you don't leave by your own accord, they will eject you.. This place is absolutely horrible. Please ASOS do not reply to this message with an automatic response saying that this is not the case. I worked there long enough to see what kind of place it is.   The advisors are constantly monitored, if you don't log in on time you will be told off even if it was a work related conversation. The weekly one to one  feedback is even worse, according to them it is our moment to shine but the truth is far from that.  They will just tak about how to improve the quality score of your response and the productivity report.   Management is really underqualified, half the advisors working there have more qualifications than them.   They didn't even let me quit in peace, management was constantly gossiping about me until the day I left. I couldn't even say goodbye to colleagues properly.. shift patterns make making plans difficult. Pointless one 2 ones each week.  New inexperienced team managers, who where out to save their own skin rather than help, didnt know the processes, so couldnt turn to them for help, when stuck in 3 live chats and need advice quickly.turnover of staff a joke. The disperance in pay between team leaders and customer service advisor, when they didnt seem to know what they where doing. if they paid them a reasonable wage, maybe everyone will get paid a reasonable wage. 3 live chats at a time. It was like being on the phone with 3 people at a time.  Awful.. ASOS have policies put in place for a reason, like most work places. There have been a few reviews about productivity/quality and what people are expected to do... ASOS expect you to try your best. Some people cant and won't understand the policies but if you have a good work ethic then you would have no problem with this as you would be doing the right thing and following the guidelines.. Not a single thing  !! - I honestly cant think of anything. Shiftwork, which isn't great for personal life - 6am- 12pm. It's not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend working here if you're looking for a 9-5 and you're not truly passionate about your role or the company's mission. This is a not a company culture where you can  'phone it in'. You can have a work/life balance here, but it's easy to get swept up in everything that's happening.. Nothing - not that I can think of anything!. Treated like school children. Training inconsistent and processes absolutely horrendous for such a large company.. - Growing pains - Promotion and growth opportunities limited - Constantly changing strategies in Tech and poor connection between Tech Leadership Team and rest of Tech team. Worse place I have ever worked in my life. They treat you like a child in primary school, the Team Leaders are absolutely useless have no idea what they are doing all they do is walk around looking for answers as they are clueless. If you want to work in a company where you want to progress DO NOT apply for ASOS as 90% off the Team Leaders have come from other companies and have not been a Customer Care Advisor before. They watch everything you do like Big Brother there will give you stupid one to one meeting which is completely pointless and irrelevant. They FORCE you to call customers even though you have told them you aint comfortable doing them as you not familiar with all the processes yet, when in actual fact its the Team Leaders job to do it. When a member of staff has been sacked or had there probation extended everyone knows about it. The Team Leader I had was a BULLY he use to shout at us when we are not hitting our targets we couldnt even book a holiday with out being questioned he wants to know why we are taking the holiday and we have to ask him for a holiday even though it has been authorised already. Also was told to kiss the top managers bum to keep my job. When you have made a minor mistake they bring you into a room in front of everyone and tell you off like a child couldnt wait to leave this company.  AVOID ASOS. Alot of office politics and favouritism. The customer care centre is poor run by ego. childish managers treating the advisors like children. You cant even go to the loo when you want. you are monitored tirelessly and patronised. There is a bery high turn over of staff.. Can't think of any cons. Team member should be briefed on the role of the intern and how they should delegate work Managers can be flaky with guidance  Competitive. Literally everything, security being horrendously tight, worked until you drop, sexual harassment to female employees, accused of being drunk, attacked by another employee.. Boring Shift It seems like a school. Unrealistic Pace/ Very 'Clique' at senior manager level. As a relatively young company it lacks the structure of other organisations, but makes up for it through atmosphere and working environment.. Prepared to be ignored if you're not part of the boys club The Tech teams are run by a bunch of bullies, it's their way or no way, even if their way is the wrong way Hard work and results are often over looked, and people are based on who they know  If you're a female in Tech don't expect to be paid anything near your (junior) co-workers. Low salary for entry level jobs. Quite informal, catty advisors to team leaders to performance managers, They lie when they say it's easy to progress. The discount was just amazing !. Not that I can think of!. I was sacked for literally being 3 minutes late when another girl on my team (white) came in late 25 minutes and was regularly late. No one said a thing to her. Manager was obviously bias and much friendlier with the white people on the team. I had been performing very well in all other areas but being one of the only ones on the team who lived a little further away I had had a few lates (max 8 mins) which I was always happy to make up at the end of the day. Shifts were terrible, your social life is non-existent with the crazy shifts you're given and they still have the cheek to constantly ask you to do more overtime.  I failed probation because of being 5 minutes late and even though the manager knew this she wouldn't tell me when I asked her at the beginning of my shift. I told her I felt sick and just wanted to know. She made me continue doing the work and said that there was nothing to worry about. My uncle had passed away the night before and by the time they finally arranged a probation review meeting to dismiss me and end my contract I was feeling very sick and I burst out into tears. They are honestly so harsh and they don't pay their employees much and try to make up for it in 'benefits'. Not acceptable.. Unfortunately people take advantage and dont pull their weight. Too much middle management Too many stakeholders Lots of politics. 3 sign off segments before being promoted. Only have opportunities be signed off twice in the year. Slow progression.. AGILE DELIVERY Managers are generally poor developers from other companies trying their hand at management. ASOS are not good at hiring good managers, I've only had one that I've completely respected and he was promoted twice, rightly so.   Poor understanding of the progression process, the skills chart has been updated so many times, no one really knows how to get a promo outside of the pub..  Facade of women in tech initiatives recently to push equality for women, when again women are still not getting equal pay. A wide spread adjustment was done very recently to try and address the difference in pay gap without mentioning exactly the reason why.. Shift work, nothing else to say. The best company I have been so far.  Hands down.. politics, made to work like robots.. Such a high turnover on all levels right to the top. That the management style , rules and office culture was always turbulent.   At time it was like a high school.. Lack of training programmes/materials Poor management. * Was not placed in the division that I interviewed for, which is absurd (and hence i did not stay long at this org) * My initial line manager was a condescending bully with numerous complaints against him * Some of the people were awful - dismissive, belittling etc. * \"Just do it\" attitude held by many managers * BIG boozing culture * Flexible working initiative not consistently implemented * The criteria for BA career progression was extremely opaque. The process was not explained during the interview process even though I very specifically asked about it * The division seemed obsessed with the process of delivery and not delivery itself; suffice to say our team delivered very little and I left because I felt this was going to look very bad on my CV * The staff turnover in tech was laughable (so high). -Politics. -Undermining and backstabbing. -Complete lack of professionalism (especially some Directors and their Mini Me Wannabes) -Heavy drinking and drugs culture (inc within the office). -Do as I say culture (dont do as I do, as I am superior)- hypocrites galore!  -Some vindictive personalities, especially within Tech -Bullying and Discrimination- discriminatory subculture exists (language and actions permeate directly from the CEO)  -Presents a holier than thou facade, everything from ethical trade to working conditions and equal ops- none of which is backed up.. It's chaotic and not in a good 'fast paced' way. It is just hugely frustrating on a daily basis.   Senior Management don't deal with poor Line Managers either.   Too many people involved in a sign off process.  Very hard to progress up through the company - there's no support from HR to do this either - so the only way to do this is leave.  For some departments, it's all about politics and egos.. The hours you have to put in are long, a healthy worklife balance isn't always possible.. - Still a corporate, things take time, lots of stakeholders. - Some incompetency in mid/senior management results in weak leadership and confusion. A lack of willingness to stand up and be counted on difficult decisions.  - The fashion side of the business often does not know what it wants, making it hard to know whether the work done will deliver any real value.  - Central teams who seem permanently unavailable, making necessary infrastructure changes near impossible, frequently blocking entire teams  - Somewhat chaotic and noisy environment at times  - Unprofessional/disrespectful behaviour in certain teams with management either participating or turning a blind eye.  - Significant unaddressed technical debt in some areas meant some teams were heavily coupled, causing significant pain in releasing.. If you dont fit in with the clique from day 1 you may as well leave. Management more bothered about hiding the truth so they look good. The bullying tactics used by MANAGEMENT seem to be the best way to get ahead.   On the outside its painted as a social fun place to work. Thats just code for drug taking and coasting through sign offs because youre part of the right clique.   Key words: backstabbing, fake, drugs, bullies, cliques, mismanagement, no mental health support, sexist, boys club, non empowering, no work life balance, poor salary.  When youre 21 and dont understand what a workplace should really be like. No one at ASOS will tell you otherwise or try to help. Not cool when its detremental to peoples mental health.. Difficult to move up with so many people working there.  Different standards held for different teams largely depending on leaders and managers. Very fast pace and changing, competition for progression. I have noting to fault about the role or the people.. No profession, can't keep up with the growth in Customer Care, don't get feedback from their advisors even though they are the ones dealing with customers every day.. Difficult to find Team Leader/Manager when there are problems so can effect performance.. long hours , can be tiring and stressful. Poor understanding of technical function and the technical director is very demotivating. - Bad leadership, very top down decisions - Central teams dictate how the platforms should work - Waterfal driven by big programs - Architecture decides everything before engaging the development teams, which at this point is too late to change. It feels like like im back in school sometimes and Id rather get more money than have drinks at work etc. theres very often no communication or a lot of miscommunication between the senior management and advisors. Theres no consistency in managing styles and there are a lot of people who should never be a part of the management.. Left on your own and hard to find help if needed. Teams are divided, if you get a good team, great, if you don't, you could experience some petty behaviour typical of fashion industries. Also you are VERY replaceable, which is a good thing too, but in my experience, people/managers didn't always keep to their word if they promised something.. - This is a retailer, not a technology company. The majority of the business sees tech & product management as \"IT\".   - Product management largely sidelined due to organisational structure, separated accountability  - Fundamentally not a very evidence-based or data-driven business, but politically-driven; priorities usually set top-down by the \"highest paid person's opinion\"  - Don't seem to promote based on merit, but years experience/age & politics. Results in employees' focus not being on delivering value for the business, but what politics they need to navigate to get promoted. Very often leads to incompetent leadership who can \"talk-the-talk\", but could never \"walk-the-walk\"  - Very frustrating place to work - huge opportunities that no-one is working on.  - Massive (very waterfall) change programs have slowed almost all forms of iterative development or innovation down to a stop  - Bloated, with many employees doing very little of value.  - Company takes the approach of throwing people at problems, as opposed to (usually very simple) use of technology to solve them.. Truly, cannot think of any. Hard to think of any. - Due to growth office is split in two locations.. Retail pay is atrocious, not competitive at all to my knowledge. Many people leave ASOS, go to Arcadia and come back on a higher pay grade and job title. Office politics exist everywhere so that's negligible Many levels to Promotions. Each JD is tiered: Entry Lvl 1/Established Senior To move up you must be assessed and or signed off. This happens every 6-12months in March & September. If you start in Feb, or Aug you have limited time to learn the role then prove your worth. So will need to work very hard to step up 2 roles. Doing your job is not enough to be levelled up. You must be doing the role above to be signed off. You have no opp to show you can you must be already doing it. Workload can be great.. Working in the ASOS studios was one of the worst experiences of my life and badly effected my mental health. I had to suffer bullying at the hands of my team leader (who had received previous complaints prior to my employment) and handle everything entirely on my own, despite my cry for help to HR (on two occasions). It was only when I resigned that they decided to listen but even then my complaint was never taken seriously. The HR department are completely for the company and are not too concerned with the wellbeing of the individual employee. The management I was under are entirely inexperienced, socially inept and unprofessional. They are allowed to abuse their position of authority without being challenged. I'm sure many of my previous employees would agree that it is more like being back at school rather than in a professional working environment. I have heard more recently that people have had mental breakdowns working here, and I was on the verge. Don't be fooled by the amazing benefits and working culture, believe me, it's not worth it! As I've learnt, it's far more important to have a healthy working environment and supportive management with good morals than having parties and cheap clothes!. You can never find your team leader if you need help with something. They expect you to not make mistakes when you've been there a day, you are expected to hit your targets straight away and get told to hurry up if you don't. Don't even think about having a day of ill otherwise you are gone.. My employment was terminated due to a few reasons, some for not following process when I was only just taught it and one of which was a fabricated reason from a leader. It was that my behavior did not suit the requirements of the role customer care advisor and that it is not acceptable to say things like 'Thanks Mate' or  'cheers bro' to the Team Leader. There was no statements taken from either side or any investigation concluded, it was just taken as fact that I must've said it. Even though I did not know this until I was in the meeting my employment was being terminated in.  All I can say is, if they don't like you personally then they will do whatever they need to, to get rid of you. Even if that means making things up likemy leader did. They also have a negative snappy attitude towards workers but this is more due to the type of Leaders that were training my group at the time, the others seemed fine.  On the plus side the termination went smoothly and respectively.. Inexperienced management, office politics, long serving employees cruising and not adding any value. No clear career progression, information not shared. Promotion is little bit difficult. Not many cons to share. Bullying becoming more and more common with a growing blame culture and unfriendly teams. Management promoted on their technical skills and constantly lack the ability to step up manage their people. Lots of cliques and catty behaviour. HR are disorganised and ignore any real issues. They will always side with the most senior person in the room. Work life balance is non/existent- if you are given the rare opportunity to work slightly fewer days you are expected to still do your full time job in that time....with less pay. Health and well-being is promoted as important to the company but realistically they will ignore any problems and class it as underperformance.. Bad communication, lack of career progression paths. No cons, the IT department is broken down into smaller teams. Every team varies.. You get some feedback when you did something wrong about the process. Sometimes, it is kinda of tricky as the processes changes all long. They are attentive to employees feedback.. Monotonous tasks, job is very boring and repetitive. Long hours (I work nights, 4 on 4 off).. No bonus sometimes long hours. I dont really have any cons to be honest. Job progression, salary, very different to other businesses. Bad pay, they play on their benefits. Takes a ages to get promoted.. sometimes felt like it was a huge organisation perhalsp bigger than i am used to, which is purely personal. obviously the company could afford you the same opportunitties if it wasnt so large, not sure if its a con as such - more that it said i had to fill this out. Retail sector is volatile, pressure, stress, competitive atmosphere, unrewarding work (personal opinion). The only thing - far from London center. Hot desking Little progression Quiet office /awkward. the building is old and uninspiring but is currently being  refurbished!. ASOS has built a great business as a marketing  x IT business. As a result there is a monolithic tech presence organised around platforms not customer needs, preferring to take a shopping list of features than explore an ambiguous space and test and learn their way to creating true customer value.   In many ways this is a corporate IT structure from 2005.   The organisation remains heavily  siloed and the suggestion of cross functional teams working towards a metric-focussed outcome is treated with suspicion by tech leadership. One suspects because it threatens their power base.   There is a strategic vacuum at the top, meaning everyone decides what they think is important. This changes on a weekly basis as plans go out the window to chase short term wins.  I'm ultimately frustrated I couldn't do more to establish a different way of working but it was a tough sell in this environment I guess - you can lead a horse to water.... Theres a lot of support and maintenance which makes a developer bored  The office is too busy and noisy  Not enough writing code. Big corporation with a lot of management.. - People talk behind your back  - No room for progression unless you are friends with a lot of the TLs  - No support  - TLs are under the age of like 21 and have no clue what they are doing  - The wrong people progress. lack of real innovation, mismanagement of resources (financial, people), short sighted as to  the industry future, focused on short term sales, general fear of doing new things, london-centric mentality,. Too much stress for such little pay. No recognition for all your work. Everything went to the managers favourite member of staff. Not enough support from management and HR. Had to leave due to being too ill from stress with no help or contact from HR even though they said they would. Rude and arrogant management - They knew they were higher than you.... Very catty!!! I expected this as its fashion but not to that extent. Felt like I was back at school. No exit interview to ask how they could improve.. shows they didn't care how and why I left. All talk and no actions. Extremely over worked. From the outside ASOS seems an amazing company as everyone only posts the fun/ exciting things about ASOS but its not true.. This are very slow to release. when money is tight there are people doing 3 peoples jobs and people who deserve to be promoted aren't. Need to listen to the people in mid level positions more before making decisions which impact their job on the software they use. Also need to remember what people are inspired by, using all money for certain events where we're unsure of the purpose instead of salaries doesnt feel right.. -Gender pay gap -Promotions structure is not clear at all, women especially dont get the same opportunities  Very strong underlying sexism culture  they have allowed harassment and bullying  Completely unsupportive and disgusting treatment if you suffer from mental health(they will likely reply to this with a whole copy and paste job about how they dont tolerate sexism and they support mental health, DONT believe the hype) I am not the first and i wont be the last woman to leave because of it!Despite their shiny image and many benefits HR will always put senior management first and not take lower down employees opinions seriously. Its a very toxic work environment.   I strongly advise not to work in technology here or ASOS in general. I worked here for over 5 years and really gave it a chance but ASOS did not ever really change their ways. There are way more tech roles in London where you will be valued, respected and rewarded. Dont be fooled by the first 5 glass door reviews on here that are all positive most likely and written by ASOS HR, dig a little deeper and take on board the real honest reviews.. Everything is a Con! I don't even know where to start. No chance for career growth, especially for non english speakers. You are treated like a kid. There are so many problems within each market and the management just pretend everything is ok, they don't work to help costumers but just to look good to the CEO eyes. Over hiring: there are many many teams that do NOTHING all day or all night long, but they keep hiring people from outside so the good employees only have to leave. I will never understand why they do this. Constant hiring of mediocre people while they should only keep the good ones. They also keep creating new teams that absolutely make no sense. Micromanagement: Team leaders need to act like kindergarten teachers because their workload is ridiculously low so they just wonder around telling everyone off it they look at their phone or if they speak in another language, they really do not know how to keep busy.. - Your rights are exploited: - you get in trouble for using the toilet for longer than 5 minutes! this will also get used against you for reviews.  -get in trouble or sacked if your off sick -get in trouble or sacked if your late even though you have legitimate reasons.  -if your going through personal crises the team leader will use it against you to get rid of you.  -a lot of favoritism happens here. Unless you are kissing the team leaders back side you won't pass probation or progress.  there are some really good staff there who have been in the same position for a very long time and they are not progressing simply because the team leader and manager doesn't like them as their personal favorite pet.   -many of the team leaders don't even like doing their job - which is to help and aid staff! they want to just sit there and gossip.  -staff are young and immature, no good worth ethics and use passive aggressive attitude to get their way.  -lie on feed back forms. some information even get erased.  -it's like being in prison. You get told off for the most ridiculous things.  -Most of the team leaders and managers apply rules to staff they don't abide by.  -working on rota and weekends can really exhaust you. the pay is not worth it. -people end up feeling depressed there -poor ventilation and poor hygiene practice. Sometimes promotions are up to financials (even though the company has a VERY stable financial background) Mobile development is not agile, more like waterfall There are no feature squads, but teams are made from homogenous members (a team is all web devs or android devs for example). Cant think of any, fast paced and a lot of work like any job worth having.. Low wage, shift patterns that change weekly. Hard to progress. Shift patterns.. Do your physical and mental well-being a favour and avoid ASOS like the plague.   As a company, theyll go to any length to protect their precious public reputation and to scaremonger their employees to avoid word being spread of the evil and vindictive work culture that goes on behind the scenes in their offices.  When you start your job with them, youll be sold a dream of an employer that values their staff, drives personal development, as well offering great benefits e.g. staff discount, free onsite gym membership, monthly free alcoholic beverages on shift etc (which youll end up relying on, to help you cope with their diabolical management), but it doesnt take long before the cracks begin to show in their cleverly executed facade.   Youll have their company values to be Authentic, Brave and Creative drilled into you from the get-go, yet youll find yourself penalised and labeled as a troublemaker if they dont like what you have to say.   Progression and promotion opportunities arent rewarded to the loyal and hardworking employees, instead, theyre given to those individuals that spend all of their time gossiping with and sucking up to Team Leaders on company time, rather than doing the work theyre being paid to do.   Passion and dedication to your role go unnoticed, but theyll be quick to reprimand you for getting up from your desk to grab a glass of water, being a few minutes late back from your break or lunch or god forbid being off sick when you are unwell. This results in extremely high staff turnover and leaves people feeling deflated and unworthy. The number of staff absences related to mental health issues triggered by the workplace is at an all-time high.   In July 2018, ASOS signed the Time to Change pledge, stating they are committed to supporting those with mental health conditions without judgement and yet on returning to work, you are asked patronising questions in a formal documented interview, designed to make you feel guilty and ashamed, such as Do you understand the impact your absence had on the business?, which sounds extremely judgement if you ask me.   If the management at ASOS had an ounce of compassion for their employees, theyd realise that they are not robots, so they shouldnt be treated like one. Its about time that they open their eyes and use their ears to start actually listening to the feedback of their staff and addressing the serious flaws within their working culture before its too late.. shift work, busy, loud office. progression has slowed down a lot recently. Good company i dont see any cons. shifts, middle management, inconsistent pay. Whilst interviewing the company tells you how much they like to push their employees and how much space to grow there is. However if you work for the office in Watford you will have have almost no chance to move up and change to the London office, even if your skills are amazing, they rather hire externally. A lot of talented people get stuck there and can't build their career the way they wanted.. Many people who work here suffer a decline in their mental health. This is known and ignored by management. Long hours, pay just above minimum wage. This is the kind of workplace that makes you work the job that you're aspiring too for 18 months to 2 years before they take your applications seriously. If you do get a promotion you'll be working alongside external applicants who get paid more than you however have little to no understanding of how to do the role meaning internal applicants get paid less to do more as they have to pick up the slack.. Lack of diversity in management.  Gender pay gap.  Shareholders are more important than employees.. was there for a few months and was sent home because of lack of work at least 1 or twice a week was bad when you travel for over an hour to get there and only work 2-3 hours.. Feel like your in prison. With the strictness on being late after lunch or break by even 1 minute.. Shift patterns can be unrealistic for your body clock. If your a minute back from your lunch its like you have committed a crime. You have to ask to go to the toilet which they monitor. No progression. Poor pay.. long hours strict management racist mangers not enough money same music everynight. Bad communication  School like environment  Patronising Managers  Treated like a child  Repetitive  Low salaries. The social aspect of the company is being cut drastically, with no more xmas parties and cutting benefits such as discounts. None at all what so ever. Mediocre pay, not very stimulating, extremely process driven. Poor for development if you are at a lower level as they do not allow you to take any further responsibilities which means you can never learn/ gain real experience until you go to a different role somewhere else or stay in the hopes someone will leave and you can apply for their job.  Communication can be poor and often feels like you voice is not heard.. Redundancies happening everywhere - at a moments notice. Interview process was slow.. Management and the amount of pressure they put on you. Shift patterns were long.. Lack of management internally  promised bonus and not received. Culture and benefits are changing a lot, not for the good either! Cutting back is evident, which effects the employee experience. High staff turnover which can be off putting. Pay and discount, work environment is fun. - unprofessional, racist management - lack of structure and policies - no clear guidance on progression - not customer oriented - cool kids club  - lies used to lure people into the business - minimal sick days - horrible pay - terrible connection to leavesden - lots of pressure on advisors and staff - overcrowded building - terrible canteen food - drug culture - uneducated managers and no support - a joke of HR (people team) their HR advisors are not trained and everybody sat in their will give you a different advice, instead of speaking to each other and advising one  or the same advice - hypocritical behaviour e.g. asos advocates for gender equality, not racially motivated etc. but are the worst when it comes to racist jokes, sexist remarks and homophobia. Salary is way below market rate, and the way promotions work resemble a popularity contest.. Once you've 'learned the ropes' the work isn't challenging, most of the hard problems have already been solved and much of the work is boiler plate rinse and repeat.  If you're looking for pure software development then you may be disappointed, the software engineer role is more DevOps so much of the job is scripting and managing configuration where much of the job is spent in a web browser battling the tooling (although there are initiatives to solve this long term).  Not all the work is greenfield, much of the system is still in 'legacy' and thus you'll be dealing with horrible big balls of mud, but this is part and parcel of most companies.  They are very slowly trying to migrate to cloud based solutions but this process will take several years.. Overcrowded workplace where often some people are bringing their personal feelings and willing to deal with arguments from outside inside of a workplace.. There are so many changes happening at ASOS that its hard to keep up. Director has very little knowledge of the business, very little knowledge of what garment technology at ASOS entails, is very impersonal and extremely demotivating. They has made so many changes to GT that it is no longer representative of garment technology as a whole - it seems as though GT is being phased out all together. They've made so many wrong decisions and has limited progression and removed so many processes that during their time there, we've lost over half of the original garment tech team and they are not back-filling either, meaning that workload is pilling up and techs are being signed off with stress (all of which management/HR doesn't seem to care about- no support is offered) There is not a single member of garment technology which is happy in their job.  There is little to no training given when you start - I was being trained up by other assistants who had started not long before I had.  ASOS as a whole are struggling massively, morale is absolutely terrible as more and more perks are slowly being removed. Redundancies are being made left, right and centre  and its very common to be walking through corridors/go to the toilets/walk around the canteen and see someone crying.  When I started almost 2 years ago, ASOS was a happy and exciting place to work, however have fallen onto hard times but has become very corporate (something they promised wouldn't happen) in that time, causing a lot of anger and frustration with current employees.  It's a very hard time to be working in the Retail part of ASOS due to cutting headcount and upping the option count, meaning that there is too much work to keep up with, too much for the amount of people they have.  I also have suspicion that many Glassdoor reviews which are popping up are fake.   It is hard to list every bad aspect of GT currently so the best way to describe it is: Garment Technology is an amazing, fun and creative profession to have, however, ASOS is not the place to practice that profession right now. Times used to be different but as long as they have the vision which is currently being rolled out, you will not be respected or be happy as a garment tech there. Perhaps in a few years, things may improve, but right now, I wouldn't bother - for your own happiness, mental health and career.. The promotion scheme is deceiving: you can nail your objectives and it doesn't guarantee you a promotion whatsoever; \"well done, maybe next year\". The web team is crippled with managers and technical figures that are long past their prime. Product teams, design teams and development teams work in silos, making the everyday completely uninspiring.. Poor retention of staff, senior management chaotic.  Long hours, grown too quickly and lacks good working practices.. Young unexperienced employees are given carte blanche festering bullies that will do nothing good for your career and making your expertise and energy worthless, The HR department called PX is the most unhelpful department. Young admins are the gateway to nowhere. Overall the company values look great on paper but the reality is completely different and very disappointing. Feels like school  Inconsistency  Poor communication.. Lack of communication from the top to the bottom. Lots! expectation of delivery remains constant even though the numbers have gone down.. Management becoming more like Arcadia, reducing benefits. Reaction and change - working in a fast paced and changing environment is to be expected in any growing company but ASOS tried too quickly to grow itself. A 'chuck money at problems' attitude.  No confidence when collaborating with other members of the team leader community due to lack of management by their manager or experience.  Nepotism is rife within customer care and most 'support' teams are made up of friends who've been given free reign to offer roles to those who have zero experience.  Development opportunities are more of a popularity contest than of deserved applications - which shows in the recent cull of people at management level. There has been a restructure due to business issues which has seen over a hundred people made redundant due to bad business decisions made the last few years.  No-one ever really seems to be pulling in the same direction - too many members of management have difference of knowledge but not in a positive way (this is down to too many senior management only having knowledge of ASOS as a business - which is an issue since the customer care department has grown).  Very specific, but the term 'perception is reality' being used by high level management as a way of judging people's ways of working or personalities within their roles. This is frightening considering the amount of people that work within customer care.  Rumours, bitchiness and college-like feel about the place is the absolute worst. It is like being back at school (that's just the management).  The current CEO.. You don't get a discount when purchasing online as full-timers do.. Terrible management Stupid processes No opportunity to growing up. business has grown faster than the leadership and infrastructure. Very little progression and pay rises.. All other events are cancelled, which includes: Christmas parties, summer parties, Friday drinks and other engaging and fun activities No free fruit Poor communication between departments, you will never receive an answer for anything, new processes are sloppy and not well though through. No opportunity for progression or growth, due to recent company cutbacks.  All vacancies have been removed No certainty about anything Overconfident management, who are not even competent to do their job and just got the position, because they work in the company for a long time.. Massive workload, feels unmanageable at times Difficult to progress Competitive. Incredibly inexperienced senior managers, who are not qualified to do the role they were fortunate enough to be quickly promoted in to, right place right time approach, inherent favouritism. No structure.. better perks would be nice!. Too many people for one job, not much to do, poor mid Level management. Try to mould you into the same people. Say theyre flexible working are not in practice. very clique within teams,  personal development has become less of a focus over the years.. Many middle managers just don't do much or have any impact. C*O to this day is the most boring person I've ever met. I avoided going to any of his meeting  unless I want to sleep.. Like any customer service job is ripetitive and pretty boring.. - Exec board are out of touch with most departments - Sometimes it can feel hard to get some work off the ground - Redundancies were recently enforced. The handling of this was terrible.  - Sometimes its hard to progress (speaking on behalf of myself and multiple people across the business). Even when you do, pay rises were minimal although work could double or triple.. the unrealistic targets abd bad enviroment. Work environment can sometimes be hostile and tense, friends move up to higher places than hard workers and HR and management can see the inner politics and don't really care enough to fix it. Some people are given better treatment than others based on who you are friends with. Many people have left recently after being driven out by these tense and stressful working environments.. Lots of legacy systems, but that could also be a unique challenge for some. The company is currently going through a lot of change which can be disorienting.. tied very closely to MS stack. not much growth for architect overlapping roles and responsibilities causes friction between engineers and architects.. Not a lot of communication with the contact centre managers.. Management reduced the amount of benefits due to latest market results. Not allowed any breaks when you go to the toilet you have someone follow you too make sure your not having a break  some staff are ignorent and don't speak to you including management. Being  scrutinised for being a couple minutes late to work/break/lunch. Feeling like youre in prison. The fact there are some team leaders that think they can act as they please and when you do make a formal complaint, it doesnt go anywhere. Instead they fire you for it and give you some bs reason, like your performance isnt good enough. God forbid youre sick or have some personal problems going on, they dont care. They never really acknowledge the good youve done, they focus on the bad. I personally believe that some people have some sort of God complex about themselves and I honestly believe some of the people there have suffered some sort of a traumatic experience because the way they treat you its as if youre the reason for their pain, so you should suffer.. Challenging commute from central London. unethical progression based on favouritism horrible hours work every 2 weekends in a month makes you brain dead. some people pull their weight more than others.. Uninspiring and removed leadership.. Salary, no career progression. No career progression to manager role. Feedbacks are not always welcome, and when they are with data and analysis, not taken in consderation. No flexibility with shifts Canteen with not very healthy food. Many benefits being removed.. High level of mico-management, not much flexibility. Clogged with rude, unprofessional lazy middle managers. A lot of hardworking talented people at the bottom who have no opportunity for progression. No pay rises for 2 years (unless youre management). All the company perks have either been removed or had restrictions placed on them. People crying at work everyday. Forced to work overtime unpaid regularly. Workplace is a health and safety nightmare, people severely injured at work, Asos weasel their way out of it being their fault. No one wants to be there.. -Terrible pay  -gender pay gap  -poor management  - bad sustainability  -no progression -high staff turnover. beirachracy was a bit too much. No Fixed shifts Working weekends sometimes. Not great pay, hard to get promoted or make a difference.. Terrible shift patterns left me tired all the time and affected my relationships. Upper management does not have a clue.. Progression is extremely slow so you dont feel appreciated. Management doesn't know/care what's going on in teams, and salaries are far below average.. Senior management make frequent bad decisions. Pay not aligned with industry rate, across all lower levels. Sizeable wage gaps. highly corporate environment and lots of meetings. Too many to mention. too much micro managing no flexibility on lateness management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising shift patterns are pretty bad, knowing a sizeable amount of people commute in from London via public transport. no opportunities for progression within, lack of functions to manage team, lack of basic kpi's (removed and new ones not fully introduced at this stage: 6 months later), serious lack of support from senior management, no training / no development (1 year in role), no accountability on poor performance, false promise of salary reviews, ... , most recently removal of employee benefits. Discrimination towards language teams Very difficult progression specially if you arent English Management lies and unqualified Salary is basic and salary reviews very little They hire teens with no work experience or work ethics Redundancies are often. Treated like a school kid by higher ups. Poor organisation. Poor Communication. Un-motivating place to work. Alot of changes going back and forth.. - Pay could be slightly higher - Hard to develop and progress as employment is slowing down. Lack of leadership on teams from more junior manager roles, more corporate than before Workload. The line manager was always on holiday despite knowing I was just a starter.  Lack of training given. Make it as hard as possible for employees to progress and hire externally when they have plenty of capable staff already in their employ. pay could be more, could have more recognition for hard work. To stressed, ridiculous targets , and team leaders are bullies. Procedures are always changing and contradicting. The company wants blood out of you. The company is very dodgy and tries to cover its tracks very strategically. Racism still exists in this company if I could rate no stars I would.. Space for growth for your career feels limited. Nothing other than workload can get a bit heavy at times, would enjoy a better work life balance. - Poor internal communications - Asos is a place where management are terrible at cascading information that you need to know down the hierarchy. This could  be staff moves , supplier /relations. This will make you feel not important. - Poor systems - well at least in my role, you will have to do everything on massive excel sheets which are on the verge of crashing your computer down any moment. Asos needs some investment in retail systems - regular emerging last minute deadlines that could easily be planned into the critical path - emails are frequently sent with deadlines due in shorter time than it takes on average to complete the task causing a frenzy which breaks down the document that needs to be filled in - poor attitude to mental health - management haven't been trained adequately on dealing with employees whose mental health is worsening and the risk it poses to Asos.  For example when a manager was told that someone on their team is suffering from poor mental health because of things going on Asos they privately berated them for not having what it takes to work at the company and excluded them for being up for any promotional opportunities.. An extremely hierarchical company with thousands of employees, can feel like you are just a cog in the ever expanding ASOS machine. There is very much a \"wait your turn\" culture so although there are opportunities to progress, you had better get in line. Senior management certainly talk the talk when it comes to ensuring employee happiness but ultimately day to day I found the culture very cut-throat and certainly experienced elements of bullying.. Slow progression, low pay.. over work and underpaid, little opportunity and benefits continuously stripped. Reduction of perks over the last 2 years (xmas party, friday drinks, free fruit, reduction of staff discount). salary is bad, no clear progression to move up.. Low salary  and expensive food  in canteen. highly unprofessional and would not recommend at all. Heavy workload, sometimes impossible. Internal communication in some areas has completely disappeared leaving employees feeling in the dark, unsupported, wary of leadership. Atmosphere has become secretive and at times hostile. A series of poor decisions has eroded the great culture and atmosphere had been built. Huge turnover and loss of talent. Inconsistency between business areas.. The parties and some of the people. Lots of promises of development and progression that never come to fruition. Inconsistencies  with management methods.  The salary is not competitive.  Put the night staff through redundancy twice in 6 months.  If your face fits, you progress.. Management style sometimes very challenging. No benefits, low opportunity for development, company in crysis. No care about employees  Awful salary  No perks  Crazy hours. Work procedures are not suitable for certain markets.. Company in crisis Salary is not competitive Very limited opportunities for progression. I no longer work there. Change in focus, lack of reporting,. Abhorrent and humiliating HR processes Severe lack of care and understanding for their people Horrendous lack of development opportunities Poor decision making from top level which has cost hundreds of jobs Poor data management and reporting capabilities for a global company. Very strict and controlling on work completed. Extremely fake, gossipy environment, a lot of bullying going on. Buyers get away with anything they want, come in late all the time, talk to you as rude as they like. Its one rule for them, another for you. You could be late a few times in one week and and theyll pull you for a chat. But dont even think about mentioning theyre late nearly every day. Dont complain to anyone above them either, or ask to move teams as youll get fired, they are all close. HR do nothing to help or support you but team up, and make up a scenario with these people to get you fired. They wont even follow the correct disciplinary procedure, even when you have passed probation. I was the most hard working person on my team staying until 8pm most days, but it was never appreciated. When they fire you they will say you stayed late because you came in late, to try and make themselves look better, when you was hardly late at all.   Do not even think about showing an interest in a different area of the business, like they promote to you at interview. They will fire you for not having passion for your role. I tried to network and ask current employees how to get experience for the role and was told that was wrong, even when the replies were helpful. I asked the interviewer for advice on how to get experience after not getting a role and I was repeatedly ignored when all I showed was extreme passion. This will also get you fired because they will complain it made them feel uncomfortable. They wont just reply to you like a normal human being would, and put you at ease, thats clearly too much for them to do as a manager.  When youre getting dismissed they will list extremely pathetic reasons to make it look more legitimate. Even things that happened before you were at ASOS, because their source on information doesnt know all the facts. Never trust anyone, when they want you gone, they will use everything against you. I dont know how ASOS get away with treating employees the way they do. Dont even think about telling HR or your head that your job is affecting your mental health, you will also get fired within days, when they make up an excuse as to why. ASOS make out they care about mental health awareness, they are liars.   You are overworked here, and stressed out, it can take 2+ years to progress to a more senior position as everyone is very clicky. People above you will give you work way above your level because theyre too lazy to do it themselves but say it is for your progression. A lot of employees in buying do not last, as no one genuinely cares about you. Take my advice and DO NOT WORK HERE.. Management is lacking and lack of respect for the employees. Customers can only contact via online. Each time customers get in touch it will be with a new adviser even if the case is ongoing.. High degree of favoritism within a team, excessive office politics between teams, and HR has zero confidentiality  Employees are often on PIP with little time to demonstrate improvement before they are terminated. Promised progression and promotion that never happened Poor communication  Struggles to make simple decisions  Poor salary  Benefits being cut School like environment  Terrible hours with very early starts and late finishes including weekends and bank holidays. a lot of tasks need to be done. Shifts are different each week, targets to hit or you are out, watch your every move. No room to progress. A lot of redundancy issues.. Pay rate, growth in career. Shifts were different every week. Not given enough support and are technical. Progression slower than some companies I have worked for previously as you get higher up in level.. bad pay, badly organised/ managed and they timed toilet breaks. Awful management No communication Treat employees awfully Hardly any progression No work/life balance due to shift patter s. Made employees redundant as a group via casual conversation!. Difficult to progress and get promoted due to limited head count. Hard to progress, mixed salaries for same role. Due to rapid growth the office was under constant change.. Can be difficult to progress.. Terrible management, lack of training for new starters, no concern for health or mental health. Terrble handling of Covid. Extremely negative place to work in, feels like highschool. The company has grown rapidly over the last 10 years and some key systems have struggled to grow in tandem. These include development, recognition and overall engagement from staff. There is also a huge disconnect between senior management and staff, especially within CC.. Overworked, extremely competitive promotions, when put forward for promtions over 100 people go for an interview process with only one position available which is extremely hard to prep for as well as doing your day job. To get signed off you need to tick off certain tasks whihc are hard to when there is not enough staff and the role is so admin heavy. Busy environment, centre of London so expensive to travel. Upper management wasnt that great and didnt listen to employees. shifts were long and weirdly spaced ,one minute on earlies then lates. Underpaid and overworked staff in my position. Challenges with some senior management, and a bit of a blame culture, which makes it difficult for individuals to thrive. Culture of long working hours, little support for flexible working within retail. -Management treat you like a slave -Team managers are entitled to talk bad to you and treat you bad -They follow you when you go to the bathroom -Management time you when you go to the bathroom -Barista talk bad to everybody. Redundancies constantly, so not a reliable role Lack of communication. No sales bonus for staffs. Financial issues, risks of redundancy.. Their employees are the least important thing to them. In the past year myself and my colleagues have been through Several round of redundancy and not once offered any kind of support or an understanding ear from upper management. The ASOSers make this company who they are and to see them treated so poorly pushed me to leave. In my own person experience, I witnessed team leaders and advisors pushed to their breaking points with no support what so ever from those direct reports. Managers dont get to know the advisors in their operations or how they are working.. Some politics across the company between departments. - Management were awful. My manager was rude, aggressive, had no idea how to manage, would actively single people out, made my life miserable the whole time I was there, mentally attacked people and their personalities - just awful. She was a BULLY, no other word for it.  - HR did nothing for their employees despite numerous complaints about these bullies - The role was completely not what it was supposed to be, I spent most of the time reconciling invoices because the company is massively in debt to their brands - Brands were cutting them off because they owed them millions of pounds, quite surprised how they stay afloat!  - Very cliquey, and not very culturally diverse. You either have to be white or act white to fit in here. - Have clothes sales for staff but most sizes were below size 6 for females, makes sense and most of the girls there do look anorexic - General bad vibe, no one I met was actually happy there but stayed because of the company. No future No opportunity  Made us redundant to employ people in Philippines. Not so much a con but this is a fast-paced company so priorities can change quickly.. nights some workers seem to know how to cheat the system. Like a robot Xpo staff are superior. Inexperienced leadership and awful shift rotation. My manager wasn't a people person. Not good management, benefits were all taken away and pay was decreased. Stretched very thin, expected to step into full time roles with minimal training.. The lack of genuine progression due to being a high performer, a culture of favouritism and praise based on friendships- if you are here to be recognised for hard work and being a good person then you have come to the wrong place - this claims to value this but it couldnt be further from the truth. No cons that I can think of except for the size of the company and industry restructures are common. Robotic, constantly being watched. Everything is tracked. Very repetitive work, management sat around doing nothing getting paid over twice your salary which isn't particularly motivating. You need to be liked for the person you are to get promotion, easy for some but frustrating for others. Clone Culture, no diversity.  Toxic HR. School like environment, not much support from management. Organisational structure is confused but is likely to change. Overloaded with work and there is a lack of professionalism at times with no clear company guidelines. poor senior management and the CEO has shown his diversity, equality and inclusion is all a smoke and mirrors act. He has repeatedly shown he doesn't care about his staff unless they're high up or stakeholders. Office is like a school playground and if you're not willing to brown nose or fall in line, you will be managed out. Red tape, complex org structure and too many middle managers. Management in cliques prevent progression.. It's a young company which you grow out of and move on.. People keeps progressing just by being there instead of recruiting actual professional for certain roles. Admin Heavy, takes long time to progress. It's a safe place to work but not very much appreciated. they fib a bit about the future. Low salaries, over worked and very busy. Hard to progress, long hours. Bad terms, bad managerial attitude. Can seem lonely, as you work independently. Stressful and very hectic at times. slow progression, feels like you are not valued. The assistants earn 18-22k and this is not enough to live in London, especially when you have to get in for 6.45-7am on Mondays and rarely get out of work before 7pm. There is a culture of over-working and if you try to go home on time there can be comments (I should mention there is a clever clause in your contract that states that you might have to work overtime for free!). Also its very high stress for the pay you get and as much as some people are lovely, some are awful and on more than one occasion I've heard people crying in the toilets.. Salary, diversity, progression, work life balance. Little room for progression, redundancy, higher up decisions made for the business and not staff. Shift based job no work-life balance  Redundancy process not ethical.  Many cost cuts that effect employees. Unrealistic understandings in TA function and the differences between tech hiring and finance, vs fashion. Not a one size fits all. really bad experience with management, someone under qualified was promoted to a team leader role and this subsequently forced most of the team members to hand in their notice due to the poor leadership and lack of care for other employees. the person in question who was promoted was the only male person within a team of about 8 and also was close friends from school with one the head of post production, who then interviewed him for the team leader role. they didn't seem to care when everyone started handing in their notice and felt deflated and demotivated to work since one of the worst members of the team was promoted .. Management have their favourite choices of photographers Freelance job days are not first come first serve but whoever they see fit  Poor communication  Will drop you without any explanation. why do I have to do this. management felt distant and cliquey i don't want to be part of the fast fashion business model that based on news and research is causing a lot of issues for the poor around the world and our planet. Too many manual processes, low salary for the amount of work, work role status is in limbo after CC redundancies. Too much bureaucracy involved meant slow paced work. perks were good at first but were stripped back, unequal pay, poor manager (as direct reports, we had more experience and knowledge than the person we reported into). Fast paced and big company, hard to stand out. Outsourcing to other countries CC is not based in UK anymore. A lot of empty promises in the end as a lot of us were made redundant (not due to COVID). Hard to progress, very limited opportunities. Slow progression within the roles. Unprofessional Company culture  Company values training programs community involvement. customers can be abuse sometimes. Customer Care now minimal and outsourced. micro management, very little opportunity for progression.. No cons, great company to join. There was a bully mentality, progression was not an option in the HR department unless you conformed. Opinions or hard work was not valued or recognised. In turn led to a lack of support or care for HR employees mental health mainly caused by a toxic work environment.. No progression, poor management, redundancy. Bus times are not great from Barnsley asos. Fast pace and always lots to do!. Continuous redundancy in the company, workload is high, slow progression and bad pay rise. Reduce workload and hire more people!. Lack of care for employees. Rubbish management You're treated like a child Never an available manager when you need one Managers don't seem to understand the job of standard advisors. Lack of work life balance and flexibility. So many levels promotions are slow. Fast paced with heavy workload. Some benefits being taken away. Micro management, no progression, redundancies. Senior management not very professional and ceo all about himself. micro management, redundancies, no room for progression. - Micro managing QA leads - Projects didn't have direction and were running over budget - Business didn't have much confidence in the tech team. GLC is still running, and it's clepotocracy, management make their own promo codes and senior management rob the company. Old CCM signed a nda after paying his own private company hundreds of thousands. The company is messed up to it's core The watford office smelt of drugs and GLC you find powder in the toliets. This is all acutally true. You could make a movie from ASOS. DO NO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. Salary isnt the greatest for the level of work done. Low hourly rate, unsociable hours. Quick to ideation, slower to deliver. Has become corporate as it has grown up over the last decade. Democracy is a plus and drawback as there can be a lot of meetings and little achieved.   If this were a smaller company I don't think it could sustain the meetings and design by committee approach. This has gotten worse in the last decade.  Recent restructure is, in the short term at least, very inefficient and came just before the most demanding part of the financial year (Black Friday Weekend). Bottle neck for progression Becoming more corporate losing core values. Poor progression Low salary progression Extremely competitive. Big walks you know man. extreme levels of workload with little relief. A lot of constant change. Feels like very slow progression. Salary does not show that they put the workers first.. Accept any roles in London headquarters only. nothing wrong, I can't think of anything. Can be long hours but this is expected. Over worked and under paid.. Pay is not a lot for my self personally.. Progression is not quick at this business. There is no possibility to grow internally. You wont understand a thing thats management is doing. Low pay and slow career progression. Below industry standard for pay. The only other issue I have is how management speak to the rest of asos. See below.. Haven't experienced any in my time there. Lacks structure due to fast-paced nature. Fast paced well established environment. Long hours poor time management and slow progression. Much more needed around flexibility - so behind the times. The Customer Care Graduate Scheme did not guarantee a job upon completion. The majority of grads ended up leaving as a result. - benefits slowly diminishing - no bonus in all my years there  - discount reduced - lack of progression/ development  - lack of movement within company. There is ZERO accountability for line managers Not encouraged to move sideways into different departments Transformation programs very messy. No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,No progress,. hectic and poor communication with little career development. Increasingly corporate Lack of diversity throughout and within board Made to come into the office throughout COVID So much work and not much appreciation. Culture, poor management, underlying internal politics, poor recruitment, poor policies. A lot of benefits have gone. Our team has lost two thirds of the people but there's the same amount of work or more. No time to focus on personal growth or anything else because there's so much work. Design leadership also gone so there's no direction or inspiration any more.. Expensive to get to each day. You need to be the management favourite. Poor management Salaries Low opportunities Strict processes Too far away from the train station. Autocratic, very bad culture/behaviours, misogynistic boys club, wild. Management / top level / pay. very cliquey, lots of micro-managing. Secondary school environment, slow progression you have tiers in the job roles eg MA has 3 levels to pass to become an AM could take up to 6 years to progress to the level above. Pay is shocking youll get better pay in a supermarket, no disrespect. It isnt what you think it will be I wish I listened to the reviews before I started. Expected to work long hours without recognition. Treated like a child. - very poor work life balance, WFH not a thing - progression is tough and there's a very much a favouritism culture - lots of unnecessary admin. None, that I would like to comment. Not enough hours a week. discount cut redundancies no more staff appreciation days no job security. very strict timings on breaks- micromanaged. - No work life balance - All benefits have slowly been reduced.. Slow progression Slow integration of new systems. Not as many opportunities for personal development. Where do I begin. Everything was wrong from the start. They were not geared up to welcome new starters and I waited 8 weeks for the systems access in order to do my job properly. I then waited a further 4 weeks for my line manager to hand over jobs to me because they are the worst micro managers and dont know how to delegate or manage their time. On top of that the blame culture within ASOS is the worst I have ever experienced, no one is accountable for anything with a lot of people looking to hide mistakes, blame someone else and talk down to you. I have spent the last 5 months being gaslighted by my boss who is incompetent and thrives off making people feel bad about themselves. The systems at ASOS are not fit for purpose and you spend 80% of your time waiting for reports to run/information to come back and even then you have to run 3 reports because the reporting system cant handle the amount of lines youre reporting on. The whole set up is a waste of peoples time and skills. I am fortunate enough to have never suffered from my mental health prior to working here but the way I have been treated at ASOS means I have suffered from the worst anxiety and panic attacks ever. There hasnt been a day I havent cried or been treated poorly and the job isnt worth it, the workload and the pay is the worst. Dont put yourself through it. They email on sundays and at 9pm + and it is not conducive to good work life balance or a happy lifeX. Sometimes can feel a little hectic, so not everyones cup of tea. However if you can handle it, youll thrive at ASOS.. toxic culture, boys club, lack of progression. the only cons no many Career Opportunities. Low salary in comparison to competitors. Have to think about it. Progression based on who you know rather than skills or experience All employees are disposable. Office politics and high turnover. There are no cons from working at asos. progression was slow and managers made it clear the level difference. Long and expensive commute from London. Big company so can get lost amongst other employees. Long hours, weekends, not enough event parties,. Weekends work management not great either. No bank holiday extras. Gone into administration. (Glassdoor would not let me select this option). the working environment could be more diverse. Very patriarchal and unrepresentative at the top.. I never openly talked about my religion but I am muslim with a black girlfriend. The culture in the ML team around ethnic minorities and muslims is disgusting. A very undiverse almost like an Oxford version of Google rejects.  Long hours with weekend working  no progression unless you know how to stroke egos  The team don't understand experimental research methods or machine learning outside of neural networks  extreme bias against working class, BAME, and muslims.  Product owners don't know much about product ownership or management. Expect you to do a job three times your salary and wont progress you. Progression is dependant entirely on your personal relationship with your team leader regardless of your personal qualities.. Dont reflect that in salary. night shift were quite long. Hours too long and different. VERY SLOW progression and not enough time to do all tasks. Always too cold, shifts, management. lack of career progression, management go on holiday when you're a new starter leaving you to manage a department on your own, you work long hours with no appreciation. long hours, and difficult technology. very little/ barely any room for growth  admin heavy   no pay for overtime. lack of support & work over time. no cons loved ever minute of it. No cons for me was a very good experience. Some organisational complexity in achieving clear outcomes. Accountability was often unclear. Technology & Product often worked against, instead of with each other. Unclear team & departmental level objectives.. Can't think of any cons. - toxic environment dominated by politics in the management layer - big egoes in the management layer - HR taking the side of the more powerful rather than acting as an impartial  - completely lack of transparency - company values are true only on paper. No or slow progression, low salary compared to some other companies. Lost it's niche! Getting too corporate.. None that you don't get in any job. Can get a bit hectic as there are so many people in one building. over worked, underpaid, very very slow progression lack of care in a pandemic stressful environment, blame culture, low morale in teams. Fast growing company that cant keep up with growth spurt. just a number, clicky, dead end job. Can be repetitive Atmosphere usually stressed. Not a huge room for progression unless people leave. Management deem you as difficult if you question there decisions. High volume and high pressured environment. Leadership could be a bit more transparent. Long hours, work life balance, blame culture. Micromanaging all over the place. Long hours, slow progression, work weekends  management/ team leaders can be extremely patronising. Management is very poor, doing everything by the book. You are always being watched, being told off even if you spend one minute extra on your toilet break. No room for promotion.. Bias agency  Hard work especially stock control Be aware of the women with ginger hair in pod 3 : NIGHTMARE. Salary ratio to Hours worked. lots of extra unpaid hours worked, hierarchy and treatment off management. I didn't get paid for my overtimes. Progression - there are 3 stages per role. 0 transparency toward the staff. Bad management  Un appreciative of staff. High likelihood of last minute team and department changes. Lack of females within the senior leadership teams.. Decision making is often questionable and you can feel frustrated.. too much work, too much fatigue, target very heavy to achieve. Communications need some improvement, lack of diversity in exec board & leadership. the workload is very heavy - expect to work a lot more than contracted hours. only black guy in the team. Not enough comms from management, cliquey, not enough diversity.. - VERY hard to be promoted, needs to be the right timing, things change a lot. - depending on you're line manger, some people shouldn't be mangers.. Very fast paced and sometimes direction can change quickly. Treated like youre at school. - lack of communication - no clear company policy/entitlement rights. Salaries have slipped way below market. 1. No more good parties. Very top down communication. No incentive or encouragement to pursue passion projects/change. Little emphasis on sustainability. Pay is okay but no room for negotiation.. lack of progression low Pay. Low salary for London life. Its a typical big corporation in many ways- high turnover of staff and the training you receive upon starting is terrible.. Can be a tough Environment to work in with high expectations and long hours. Department lacked vision and leadership was lackluster. Outsourcing to poor external company caused more problems than it solved. Benefits increasingly reduced. Hamstrung by poor policies e.g. we would be punished if we attempted to refund a delivery charge (for a late delivery or in the case that an order wasn't delivered) unless the customer actively asked us to.. management , wage , hours , facilities. Progression within department is next to impossible. long work hours, normal pay. * Management are often quite late in sharing organisational changes * For the work that LSEs do, they deserve a little more compensation. Some Company benefits depend on department. Pair programming disaster, chaos environment, noise in the office, low salaries, no bonus, siloses of knowledge, architects living in their own world. Low salary compared to other businesses. Clear favouritism within the organisation and salary did not quite match with the workload. Working on womenswear - not such a good vibe Some people have big egos Teams work differently within a department. Very little progression, base salary is very low. Kids managing kids, poor leadership, more invested in making the work place look nice than how they treated staff. My impression of this company is that it is full of jerks. They're above average in the narcissism department, but I don't think that explains it entirely. I read in another review about islamophobia. I was also shocked by attitudes towards muslims during my very brief time at ASOS. Attitudes from some quite well paid people. I complained about it to HR. They told me I was lying. When I proved I wasn't they said they didn't care. It felt at times like working for an organised crime ring. I've worked for a lot of companies. I found this place horrid. And depressing. I don't think I've ever found going into work so depressing in my life.. Nepotism C suite arrogance Lack of innovation. Where do I even begin with this? We were overworked and underpaid, expected to work long hours (particularly on Monday when the systems would crash as you tried to do anything). If you left on time youd be on the receiving end of tuts and snarky comments.  There was absolutely no chance for progression. I made it clear during my interview that was what I was looking for in this job and was promised the world but what I found instead was tasks being dropped on you from a higher level under the guise of progression, only to receive no assistance and when you (inevitably) fail youd be blasted in front of the whole team. Youd also be expected to cover colleagues work when on holiday which on its own is not a unfair request but on multiple occasions I had to pick up a colleagues task they had left for days only to be told off and when I couldnt cover my workload, their workload, helping to train a new person and the task theyd just left prior to their holiday - somehow myself not being able to cover this was my issue and not the issue of the person on holiday.  This brings us to the biggest issue I found at ASOS the workplace bullying. I loathe to call someone this but my manager was nothing more than a bully protected by the managers above them. Once they had decided they had it out for me my time was done and I was bullied to the point of a mental breakdown, and pulled into a meeting where I felt I had no choice to quit or be fired. In a last ditch attempt I went to HR only to have them feed back to my bullys manager who in turn pulled me to one side and brought up the comments I had made. So much for confidentially. In the end I felt like I had to rescind my comments in my exit interview for fear of my reference being in danger.   Never been so happy to leave a job in my life.. nothing bad to say about it really. On your feet all shift. Poor management who are completely detached from the processes involved in entry level roles, lack of support for new employees, difficult to progress (very rigid promotion structure where you have to be in specific roles for a certain amount of time before being 'allowed' to be put forward for promotions), don't often have enough time in the day to make use of any of the perks, lots of staff are extremely unhappy and the retention rate within teams is low.. management , building , lowering the discount , making people redundant. People with a bit of power are arrogant, from other deparments as well, there are no team work at all and no chances to progress if you're a foreigner.. no personal life, extremely stressful, limited work life balance. Senior leadership rolling back benefits, terrible pay (despite increased profits) & many senior team managers have no people leadership skills. Favouriting managers, poor level of management. Progression  salary increases Diversity needs to improve. Toxic, No room for progression, treated as a number, not respected, undervalued, overworked, cliche fashion environment   \n",
