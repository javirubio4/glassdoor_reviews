A lot of your experience will be determined by those around …  you rather than the company as a whole. 
Colt predominantly focuses on the UK and EU customers and more recently Asia  
--------------------------------------------------------------

I worked in the UK, London Office 

Carl Grivner, CEO. He knows what he is doing, comes across as humble and has sensible plans. they are certainly working hard to have a diverse set of people to work for the company unfortunately they are losing the skills and experience of employees replacing new for old (recruiting interns/ grads and slowly and quietly making employees who have been around for 7+ years redundant) which is clever if you think about it paying a lot less and saving money for the business.
He Also emphasizes that Colt has a role to play in society with the work they do around CSR which was actually something that was started by the previous CEO Rakesh Bhasin

Learn on the job. You don’t need to be up to your eye balls in fancy qualifications to do most of the jobs.  teams are so varied you have to just have a good attitude and work hard to get it.
Diversity. People don’t care about your background, ethnicity or anything like that – it’s what you bring to the table 

Work Hours are flexible and you can work from home depending on your role

The People. On the whole they are a nice bunch of people to work with. They are always busy but are approachable and you will often find one person having multiple roles
Work Environment. It’s quite good to be fair, they have invested heavily in a new office (in London) and more up to date equipment (Laptops)","Okay, so now you know about Colt it’s become apparent that it is very hard to climb the corporate ladder. Each company has its own large hierarchy with hundreds of people working for it; due to the numbers involved it is often the case of not what you do but rather “who” you know which will allow you to progress. You can get someone incredibly talented at but will never get chance to move up and really shine due to the odds against them – this means that good people leave as they aren’t progressing as quickly as could have been. Based on what I’ve seen people usually leave the firm after 1-2 years (sometimes just after 1 year) at lower levels as it dawns on them that you are playing a numbers game.

Politics. Okay, I’ve yet to work for any company where people don’t play politics; it’s a fact of life. Unfortunately I feel that those that have made it to pretty good positions (VP, Director level) are reluctant to do good job and end up falling into the politics game. I hear very senior people saying “work together as one company” but in reality in each team managers are playing politics and looking after their own interests. No one from very high up ever visits the ‘ground troops’ and so they are out of touch of what it’s like back on the floor (I assume they are always in important meetings being told everything is fine).

Pay and bonuses. I said this a few years ago and it’s still the same – unless you are one of the lucky few forget about being handed a cheque with a long number on it. Those days are well and truly over….infact they never existed in Colt Sure, some lucky senior people will get a big reward but most of us are just well paid grunts. Speaking of which the pay is not amazing, however when you work it out per hour it’s honestly not above and beyond any other place. My contract states my working hours are 9-5. Every day I work 08:30 – 18:30, which is alright (it used to be a lot worse 3 years ago!). I don’t get rewarded for all those extra hours though so it makes my bonus almost insulting each year. Every year people go into “the room” expecting to be told you’ve just got a big fat pay check and every year you get told “here is your 0.5% pay rise and £100 bonus”. G

Annual reviews. Seriously – there isn’t any point if I’m honest. There isn’t a structured career path for most to take. It’s like most jobs – take your seat, work hard based on your role, think outside the box by making stuff better and learn some things along the way. There isn’t anything I’m aware of where they have a structured career path, despite HR making out there is such a thing. My manager is woeful at best; it’s like taking career advice from a fast food manager with politics thrown into the mix.

Leadership. Same as everywhere else I’ve been. Lots of managers but not natural leaders. A lot of managers are not real leaders, despite what they view themselves as; happy to delegate and be the chief getting paid the most but somehow avoid listening to concerns, helping nurture talent, provide knowledge to those below, working with other teams. Usually a case of “I’m in charge do what I say” rather than “I have something to teach”.

Pigeon Holed. People feel like they are stuck in certain roles and are not given the chance to move. A complete “us and them” attitude – both don’t know what is really involved by either side. 

You made it! Now you can read about that dreaded one star rating that makes you question if the whole company is rotten to the core (it’s not; it’s down to who you end up working with, promise). :)Show

I am definitely NOT paid to say any of this. I actually owe them money, but I'll come on to that later...

- Reputation
This company is very rewarding to work for. It's prestige, the look people have when they find out, respect, honour...

- People
Pretty much every single person I met is good company. Everyone is very supportive, working there is fun. Considering some of the things I will mention below, bonding with these people is an enjoyable experience.
This includes management, I don't believe I will get so lucky again to have boss(es) just as nice.

- Money
Obviously, contingent on you laying down your very soul to work as hard and as much as you can, you can take up to £10k a month, easy. (Disclaimer: obviously after years of experience and considering you are good at this job)

- Progression
People who are suited for the roles can climb pretty high up the ladder pretty quickly. Best I've heard was from OC to Valuer in two years. 

- Location
They have 67+ offices across London, you will not have to travel far for work and that is something precious in this London world we live in...

- Training
LOVED IT. Very exciting, interesting, comprehensive and valuable. Amazing people throughout the company - HQ have a very high-calibre team.
Ongoing training means you are constantly improving, learning, evolving. It's incredibly helpful, pretty self-explanatory.

- Company Car/Phone
This role in my opinion is the coolest job you can have if it all adds up for you. 
Complete flexibility, you can use both for business and personal use, they pay for petrol, office parking and phone contract. 
You will be randomly assigned either a branded Mini, or an unbranded Vauxhall, Pegeot, or something else go-carty. Opinions differ as to which is better, but only £200,000 or so later you can move on to the unbranded Mini so it's all good. Very possible to achieve in the first year, I've seen.

- Other Incentives
There's so much I'm just gonna list. A bottle of Moet for your first deal. £50 cash every week for the best figures in the office (like a prize draw, but complete meritocracy style). Trips e.g. skiing, office/area/company parties and outings and get-togethers.","- Hours
On average I did between 60-65 hours a week. One of the main reasons why I left, I couldn't handle it. Roughly 8am-8pm Mon-Fri, and 9-4 every other Saturday.

From the psychotic micro managing and bullying to the fear of culture created at the top and passed down the chain, it was a miserable atmosphere from start to finish. Senior people throw junior staff under the bus at every opportunity. 

When I began my role I was overloaded me with work and gave no advice, support or training, I was thrown in the deep end but tried to take it in stride and give it my best shot, acknowledging I was new so inevitably going to make some mistakes along the way. Everything I did was wrong, I was constantly criticised but given no help for me to improve. I was bombarded with emails and skype messages all the time, management constantly checking in every 5 minutes and demanding I give a rota every single day detailing what I would do at what times of the day. I thought this was a bit much and maybe they just needed to see I was competent and could be left to complete my work. This micro management carried on and was quite unbearable. The management would gas light me regularly in front of other colleagues, once even shouting “what have YOU got to be stressed about?!” in front of the whole office after bombarding me all day and seeing me slightly frazzled asking if I was stressed, I replied “Yes a little” and was shouted at. I was mortified and this was my first warning sign I'd bitten into a bad apple. They would also withhold information so that I ended up looking silly in meetings and not seeming like I know what I'm doing. We worked with external agencies and I was told I was 'too friendly' to the staff at these agencies, and that what I really needed to do was ""be rude to them"". I was pretty shocked by this and looked to see if I could change management. I was still pretty new to the company so thought it may be one bad egg and that I'd just been unlucky. 

I was only ever given administrative work. I thought - ok, this isn’t what I was hired to do but there are always times you have to roll up your sleeves and do boring stuff for a few weeks. The weeks turned into months, months of copying data from one spreadsheet to another. Thousands of items of data, I was shocked nothing was automated in the team. Not being a person with any background of data entry or data admin, I of course made human errors within these data sets and was lambasted for it. I was criticised for having a ‘lack of attention to detail’, meanwhile being shunned from any meetings with anyone from Deloitte outside of the team. I wasn’t allowed to email anyone who wasn’t in the team for the first four months of my time in the team. I felt like Harry Potter being hidden away in a cupboard under the stairs. I was so looking forward to all the great training opportunities I’d heard about when joining. These never appeared and when I asked for training I was told to look at the internal Learning platform and do online multiple choice tests. 

I took a look at my original job description a few months in to check I wasn’t losing my marbles and realised I hadn’t ever been given any tasks related to what was on the description. I was strictly given spreadsheets to copy data to and from, extremely long and dry reports to read and glean highlights from, and operational admin tasks as the management decided to construct many ‘trackers’ to assess progress with tasks. We had in excess of 18 trackers, which management regularly wanted reformatting. This was the case with a lot of the work I was given too. It felt like there really wasn’t any real work to do - we were in essence digital paper pushers faffing about on spreadsheets, reformatting work over and over again until it eventually pleased our overlords. I once spent 30 hours reformatting a long slide deck, changing the layout of the slides over and over again as per management's changing requests. When I was given long, tedious admin tasks I would calculate how long they would take me and let management know I was going to be busy with it for x amount of time so might not be able to do much more until x date/time if this was really urgent. I was told that by giving management an idea of how long it would take me to complete a task, I was being disrespectful. 

I feel I was deliberately held back a number of times. My probation was extended twice (9 months in total) and I was denied a coach, training and opportunities as a result of this. Before joining the company I regularly spoke at conferences and panel events. During my interview I mentioned this and asked if this would still be allowed. I was told yes, that it wouldn’t be a problem so long as the event was legitimate and not offensive in any way (a fair caveat). However 7 months into my tenure, I was invited to a virtual panel event. I was really excited so asked the head of the team if that was ok with them and they replied that it wouldn’t be ok as I was still in my probation period (despite having been with the team 7 months). I was really disappointed by this.

I was also asked to move my holiday twice and told I wasn’t allowed to take 5 days off in a row, however the management were allowed this. The environment within the team was extremely hostile and disempowering. We were notified of a change in the team and when I asked what the reason for the change was I was told it was ‘not my place’ to ask questions. The irony of this is quite something when you realise the firm claims it wants people with ‘curious’ minds. The management team lacks intrinsic logic in a lot of instances but when you ask a question or raise a point as a junior member of the team, you are shunned and told off for it. It’s a horrid atmosphere to work in.

I had 5 years experience in one area prior to joining the team and was excited to add value to projects, however both management often commented that “you won’t know about x”, rather than asking if I might know about x, and often I did. I found this really patronising and an insult to my knowledge. Ultimately, no one ever asked for my thoughts or strategic input on anything over the course of 10 months. Not once. They may as well have hired a data robot and saved some cash. 

I worked hard, often 10-12 hours a day, getting up early and staying way past 5.30pm to respond to the endless emails coming through and ensure all my work was done on time (with no overtime pay as we weren’t allowed to enter this on the system according to the team lead). I was eventually invited to a ‘Development meeting’. I thought this would be a great turning point and I could finally work on some marketing projects. I asked if I should bring or prepare anything for this but was told no and that it would be casual. I joined the meeting and was presented with a spreadsheet of EVERY mistake I had made (mostly the data in the spreadsheets with the thousands of data sets) and some accusatory statements of things I definitely hadn’t done or things that seemed weird to criticise someone for ‘asking questions to management that are above my level’ and for an hour management went through this spreadsheet, attacking me, offering no support or help and throwing criticism after criticism at me. I left the call after an hour and completely broke down. I don’t know how or why these people are so cruel. I answered an ‘anonymous’ wellness survey and gave some insight into what was happening. I do not believe it was anonymous now as the bullying got worse and worse from this point. I was finally let go on the spot, given an immediate dismissal out of nowhere. No proper process was followed, no written warnings or performance review, just a straight boot out the door during a global pandemic. The company has been completely soulless in my experience. None of the management have contacted me since, not even a thank you/goodbye/good luck text from management I think I ran into the worst kind of humans here. These people are extremely damaging to the Deloitte brand, do not uphold any of the values of the company and have many internal rifts with other teams. I cannot stress enough that this was not worth the money and to anyone thinking of joining, brace yourself and prepare for the gauntlet of office politics.",2020,only good thing job salary extremely

I was happy at my previous organisation, so when I received an unsolicited call from the retained recruitment agency, asking if I was interested in a new role, my initial thought was 'no, but I might as well see what the role is'.

By the end of the (2 hour!!) call, I was literally chomping at the bit to join the team! Tales of sales award trips to the Caribbean, a (at the time pending) policy of unlimited paid PTO (holidays), and an enviable position of market leader in their space had me hooked.

After my interview process (with Mike and a few others), I was absolutely compelled by their passion for the organisation, as well as delivering an Incredible Customer and Employee experience.

Life at Bullhorn has never disappointed from the 'sales pitch' of the interview stages. We truly do live our core values and customer mission statement. Everyone, from Art down, is accessible for questions, suggestions and comments. 

If you are looking for a fast paced, customer obsessed, cutting edge company - which delivers an amazing employee lifestyle, and which lives its core value and mission statement - then Bullhorn is probably for you.

There is a comprehensive employee package, but just as importantly (to my mind), we are a TEAM. There is a huge emphasis placed on our core employee values, and employees are actively encouraged to call out colleagues or managers (in a constructive way) for slipping below the line.

Cross functional collaboration has needed a shot in the arm, but that's part and parcel of a growing 600+ employee organisation - a bit like an awkward adolescent becoming an adult. It was only ever a minor annoyance anyway, and never got in the way of our company mission.","Not really a con as such, as all truly global organisations face the same issue, but: Timezones can sometimes prevent truly collaborative sessions across multifunctional teams - it will always inconvenience someone!

I have worked for many different companies and with many different people and I have only ever been friends with a handful of them, but working for Nandos I have met a lot of nice, friendly, and considerate people who I have formed some good friendships with. Every year I attend an annual meeting with the other Store Reps and it is a great opportunity to meet new Nandocas as well as chatting to the Reps in my region.

Another great thing about working for Nandos is the fact that the managers listen to you if you have a problem they will help you solve it. If you have a family emergency or problem then they will do what they can to help you. They are flexible when it comes to the rota if you need a particular day. The management at Nandos is great. 

You get some very good perks at Nandos too. You receive a 40% discount Monday-Thursday and 20% Friday-Sunday. You get access to Perkbox where you can get up 25% off certain goods and services, including Gym Membership, Book tokens, flights, hotel bookings, clothes, and much more.
 Twice a year you can apply for the Cycle-2-Work scheme, you simply apply online for a bicycle and the payment is taken from your pay per week. This is a great scheme that can help you get fit and lower your carbon footprint.

At the end of every year is the Christmas Party, this is a great night for all concerned as it gives us the chance to forget about work and have a drink (or two) and let our hair down and have a lot of fun. Then there is the annual awards, the Nandoscas. This takes place in May and again is a great night out for everyone. It is especially great because it is when Nandocas are recognised and awarded for their hard work. I have been nominated and won several awards of the last five years and I have to say it is both humbling and gratifying to know that you are appreciated by your peers. There is also Family Day, which takes place in August. This is where Nandocas from your region gather together with their families to enjoy good food, drinks and lots of fun.

Looking back on 5 years of service I can say, hand on my heart, that Nandos is a company which truly cares for its staff. It is a kind, caring, friendly and down-to-earth company who will do all they can to help you further your career. 
I have watched a lot of Nandocas come through our doors and it is great to see the change in people. We often get young teenagers starting, often as their first job and I watch them mature into positive, more knowledgable people.

I have changed too in these 5 years. I have matured and I have become more confident and I am more able to express myself. Before working at Nandos, I wouldn't have even entertained the idea of attending a Christmas Party but working at Nandos, I feel comfortable enough to go out and party with my friends.

Nandos is a fantastic company to work for, the best company I have ever worked for in fact.

During these unprecedented last few months, Nandos has been unfailingly supportive and caring. I have spoken to my Patrão regularly and she has kept me and my fellow Nandocas up to date with regards to the restaurant. Nandos has kept us all safe.","There occasions where we will get out after midnight, and even 1 am. Not fun but there are usually exceptional circumstances so it doesn't happen that often. We also, occasionally encounter rude/ungrateful or unappreciative customers. Though again they are quite rare, our customers are almost always friendly, kind and understanding.

I have on occasion dealt with some Nandocas who were not easy to work with. They would abuse the Family and Emergency Service discount or give their friends free food or drinks and talk to me and others in a disrespectful or aggressive tone if asked to do something they didn't want to.",2020,good thing work nando people work different company different people only friend handful work nando meet lot nice friendly considerate people form good friendship year attend annual meeting store rep great opportunity meet new nandocas chat rep region great thing work nando fact manager listen problem help solve family emergency problem help flexible come rota need particular day management nando great good perk nando too receive discount monday thursday friday sunday access perkbox certain good service include gym membership book token flight hotel booking clothe twice year apply work scheme simply apply online bicycle payment take pay week great scheme help fit lower carbon footprint end year christmas party great night concerned give chance forget work drink let hair lot fun annual award nandosca take place great night especially great nandoca recognise award hard work nominate win award year humble gratify know appreciate peer family day take place august nandocas region gather family enjoy good food drink lot fun look year service hand heart nando company truly care staff kind caring friendly earth company help career watch lot nandoca come door great change people young teenager start job watch mature positive knowledgable people change too year mature confident able express work nando entertain idea attend christmas party work nando feel comfortable party friend nando fantastic company work good company work fact unprecedented month nando unfailingly supportive caring speak patrão regularly keep fellow nandoca date regard restaurant nando keep safe,occasion midnight not fun usually exceptional circumstance happen occasionally encounter rude ungrateful unappreciative customer rare customer always friendly kind understanding occasion deal nandoca not easy work abuse family emergency service discount friend free food drink talk disrespectful aggressive tone ask want,great company great job,"{'pay': {'negative': 0.0014171582, 'neutral': 0.015824279, 'positive': 0.9827586, 'label': 'positive'}, 'management': {'negative': 0.001424411, 'neutral': 0.015824752, 'positive': 0.98275083, 'label': 'positive'}, 'growth': {'negative': 0.0013942719, 'neutral': 0.015737673, 'positive': 0.9828681, 'label': 'positive'}, 'benefits': {'negative': 0.0014045426, 'neutral': 0.016101433, 'positive': 0.98249406, 'label': 'positive'}, 'flexibility': {'negative': 0.0014016193, 'neutral': 0.016154617, 'positive': 0.98244375, 'label': 'positive'}, 'people': {'negative': 0.0014235405, 'neutral': 0.01581996, 'positive': 0.9827565, 'label': 'positive'}, 'tools & resources': {'negative': 0.0014259005, 'neutral': 0.016213115, 'positive': 0.98236096, 'label': 'positive'}, 'teamwork & collaboration': {'negative': 0.0014506553, 'neutral': 0.015777025, 'positive': 0.9827723, 'label': 'positive'}}",{}

The shops are quite pretty places to work with an upbeat atmosphere that isn't *too* annoying.

They do now pay more than the average highstreet shop.

Due to the shops grand expansion plans there is plenty of room for quick advancement if you do well.

They always need roaming cover in other stores so if you want more hours they will be there, but you can keep it to a minimum when you like. This makes it flexible for students.","... That isn't saying much. It's good they've committed to the living wage though it's sad that's even worthy of credit. I was on £7 an hour when I started there two years ago. I think that they have an unfair system of blurring the lines between roles. For instance in a small shop they don't have an assistant manager role available just a manager, say 2 or 3 full timers and a few part timers. However all the same paperwork must be generated every day, every week. So effectively the full timers would have to take on those roles, write those reports, be key holders. Extra work and responsibility not reflected in their role or £7 an hour. This paperwork of daily sales reports etc could also have been computer generated at head office, but instead the old clanky system made the staff work it out everyday. All because HO couldn't/wouldn't work it out. 

They had utterly unrealistic expectations of staff. You weren't just meant to turn up on time and serve customers politely. You were meant to demonstrate psychologist skills in convincing customers to buy things, chase them round the store, clean constantly, generate paperwork, wrap everything, stand up straight, etc. You were really expected to CARE and be emotionally involved in the future of the company which after a while on £7 an hour 

Other issues are the fact it was expected that we would wear Oliver Bonas clothing though they couldn't enforce this because if they did it would be a uniform and they would have to provide it for free legally. This wasn't so awful as they offered a 70% off discount on the clothing and it was mostly quite comfortable clothes to wear at work. High heels were not allowed as a health hazard. I've noticed their staff are always wearing OB clothes now and when I was leaving they were pushing in that direction so maybe they offer a uniform allowance now. I can't say. 

From a consumer perspective I would say that quality control isn't great and the onus was put on staff to spot faults and get them off the shop floor rather than relying on the factories. I have worked in many shops and I have to say the QC was awful in OB. I don't mean to say overall quality was poor. It was just incredibly inconsistent. This was due to the fact that they are a mixed lifestyle brand so many of their items are bought at trade markets where in terms of price it's a race to the bottom. The margin on most things was remarkable. This also raises questions about who is making these items and their materials. More and more lines have moved in house since I left so possibly this has improved.

I do feel that as a brand they professionally rip off other companies work which whilst common is rarely so clear. Down to items like ""a detox pack"" or hand creams etc which all used to be made by a variety of cosmetics companies and have now all been duped IDENTICALLY for own brand. Price up, margin down. The company would have more longevity I think if it invested in it's own style and raising standards.",2017,major pro feel work oliver bona hire staff retail extremely friendly competent work store good idea kind people hire genuinely enjoy people work find usual bitchiness retail shop pretty place work upbeat atmosphere too annoying pay average highstreet shop shop grand expansion plan plenty room quick advancement like work time low hour offer always need roam cover store want hour minimum like make flexible student,say good commit living wage sad worthy credit hour start year ago think unfair system blur line role instance small shop assistant manager role available just manager timer timer paperwork generate day week effectively timer role write report key holder extra work responsibility not reflect role hour paperwork daily sale report etc computer generate head office instead old clanky system staff work everyday ho work utterly unrealistic expectation staff just mean turn time serve customer politely mean demonstrate psychologist skill convince customer buy thing chase round store clean constantly generate paperwork wrap stand straight etc expect care emotionally involve future company hour issue fact expect wear oliver bona clothing enforce uniform provide free legally awful offer discount clothing comfortable clothe wear work high heel not allow health hazard notice staff always wear ob clothe leave push direction maybe offer uniform allowance consumer perspective quality control great onus staff spot fault shop floor rely factory work shop qc awful ob mean overall quality poor just incredibly inconsistent fact mixed lifestyle brand item buy trade market term price race margin thing remarkable raise question make item material line move house leave possibly improve feel brand professionally rip company work whilst common rarely clear item like detox pack hand cream etc variety cosmetic company dupe identically brand price margin company longevity think invest style raise standard,good place work highstreet,"{'pay': {'negative': 0.017429892, 'neutral': 0.13961186, 'positive': 0.8429583, 'label': 'positive'}, 'work-life balance': {'negative': 0.016233409, 'neutral': 0.13349883, 'positive': 0.8502677, 'label': 'positive'}, 'growth': {'negative': 0.01582596, 'neutral': 0.13034013, 'positive': 0.8538339, 'label': 'positive'}, 'culture': {'negative': 0.016384106, 'neutral': 0.13307163, 'positive': 0.8505442, 'label': 'positive'}, 'flexibility': {'negative': 0.0164497, 'neutral': 0.13492818, 'positive': 0.84862214, 'label': 'positive'}, 'people': {'negative': 0.017133709, 'neutral': 0.1352938, 'positive': 0.8475725, 'label': 'positive'}}","{'pay': {'negative': 0.67011535, 'neutral': 0.28075564, 'positive': 0.04912893, 'label': 'negative'}, 'job role clarity': {'negative': 0.6689989, 'neutral': 0.28153822, 'positive': 0.049462903, 'label': 'negative'}}"

Con 2: The leadership don’t have a clue what they are doing

There have been two rounds of redundancies recently - the first for cost-savings, the other as a re-structuring following new people taking over the function. The re-structuring just made things worse. Clever people with a lot of knowledge were made redundant while many of the least competent remained. Most people who were offered a choice between redundancy or taking a new role chose redundancy. The graduates hired on the graduate scheme are usually more competent than the senior people telling them what to do. The amount of people in middle management seems have dramatically increased, yet any developer will tell you that the output (in terms of quality and quantity) has remained relatively unchanged - so it’s a mystery what value all these middle managers are adding. The Product Owners don’t understand their own products. The leadership are incapable of communicating even the smallest of changes - decisions seem to be made by a small group of people in the only office on the floor. On a number of occasions when certain changes were announced and some tried to explain why they were bad ideas, the responses were “this is not a democracy” or “this is just the way it is”.

Just one week before Christmas an email was sent out telling employees it was mandatory to take several days of annual leave over Christmas — seemingly no thought is given to actually tell people things like this in advance.

Previously a big benefit of working here was that you were at least trusted to do your work — if you wanted to work from home a couple days of week, then that was fine. But employees are no longer trusted. Flexible working and other benefits are being removed.

When a new HR scheme was announced to be able to buy up to 5 days of holidays per year (a scheme which the vast majority of big companies have), the only question the Head of Digital asked was “how do we measure the negative impact this has on productivity?”.

There are of course worse places to work. But if you are even an average software developer and you want to:
- be productive
- work with people who know what they are doing
- have an opportunity to actually make an impact
then you will easily find somewhere better to work than here.

To make things worse, the management are constantly moaning about the state of the company, which is terrible for morale, but they do not do anything about it, just shout and scream. Most of the staff there have totally lost any enthusiasm, I think on average it takes about a month. This leads to sloppy or lazy performance. The building (Clerkenwell) is a state, the toilets are always filthy, or blocked. No one makes any effort to clean after themselves in the kitchen.

Every site I've worked at the culture and environment has been excellent and one that is shared amongst employees. 
Another pro for XPO Logistics is decision making. Each site is viewed at as it's own business and you are empowered at to make business decisions. The flat structure supports this and it really does drive growth and also innovation within sites.  
Across the UK and Europe we have great strength in many business sectors in particular E-Commerce. This businesses approach and expertise will see XPO grow further within the E-comm sector and also gain a stronger footprint within Food and Retail.

13391,BT,2015-08-08," Band II Manager, II Years' Experience","Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England, England",5,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,v,v,v,"Massively important, rapidly-evolving FTSE 100 company in a vital sector of the economy","- Fascinating, vibrant and rapidly-evolving sector of the economy (IT & Telecoms) which demands a broad range of skills to understand it, implement it, and deliver and explain it to customers.
- Lots of very bright people - which makes for a great working environment.
- The BT Graduate scheme in particular gets superb people, and they tend to cluster in certain parts of the business, e.g. Consumer - TV, Mobile, Broadband, Telephony to non-business customers. (Disclaimer: I am not an ex-BT Graduate myself.)
- Investing hugely in new technologies - which means that change is constant, and good people are needed to lead that change.
- Highly competitive area: Sky, Talk Talk and Virgin are snapping at our heels: so we're forced to be on our 'A game'.
- Genuine investment in talent: people can and do promote rapidly up the ranks, based on merit. Some of the leader in Openreach, in particular, are hugely impressive.
- Extremely flexible work-life balance: many people work from home, and hours vary from 7am-4pm to 9am-7pm, for example; what works for a mother with kids living in Yorkshire is different to a single guy in Central London.
- Widely geographically dispersed: lots of jobs in lots of places, so you can move around within the company as the requirements of your spouse and family change.
- Real investment in to training and development: I've been amazed how much effort managers, and the company, put into developing people.","- Some tangible vestiges of a public sector culture, particularly in Openreach (the engineering part of BT). This will change as people retire from the company, and the new National Ops and TV arm of Openreach is led by a very capable Director (and MD), and infused largely with new recruits from outside BT, who don't have the traditional union mindset. (For example, one ex-Army warrant officer, a few weeks in to working for Openreach, was angrily told by a 20-year veteran engineer: ""Oi - You can't do more than three [engineering] jobs a day: you'll show us all up!"". His response was a brisk ""F--- off!""; but younger and more junior personnel are more likely to intimidated by such 1970's attitudes. They are dying out/being weeded out, but not fast enough.

- It is difficult to sack poor performers, like the engineer in the anecdote above. Friends have had to 'case manage' difficult people who have played the system for decades, milking it for time off, sick leave, and money, but who HR don't seem to have the appetite to dismiss. There should be greater resources available to target poor performers, give them the opportunity to improve, and then sack them if they don't. This includes being willing to defend ourselves at Employment Tribunals.

- The corollary of the 'rapidly-evolving' aspect, above, is that change is also constant. This is great if you are confident of your ability, have a strong CV, and are flexible, but there is also an important place for stability: life's rich tapestry is represented in BT as in other organisations, and those who have served many years, and are working exceptionally hard, and delivering superb results (£££ revenue, ££££ EBITDA - tangible results) often feel deservedly betrayed when arbitrary cost-cutting in other parts of their Line of Business adversely affects them.

- Cost transformation (ie 'cutbacks') sometime goes too far: there are numerous examples of lost opportunities, for example in BT Business (and I suspect, but do not know first-hand) in Global Services of lost chances to pursue high revenue & EBITDA opportunities due to somewhat deceitfully-named 'headcount challenges', ie cut-backs.

Not too formal a work place, comparatively. 

Overtime always available, except after Christmas, and I found that managers would be flexible about working extra hours. With my manager's approval, I was allowed to come in an hour or two early on days when I could fit it around my schedule, to make up a bit of extra overtime.

Trying to be more involved with staff, as of recent updates. Started hosting 'listening groups' and staff awards etc. to try and bridge the gap between staff and management, and address some problems staff had found with our store.

When we finished early, or the store wasn't busy in quieter months, we would be allowed to go home early after closing sometimes, or otherwise take part in staff engagement activities, which could sometimes be fun.

Pay is above minimum wage for under 25s.

They have recently improved their staff discount - 10% off is now available for 8 weeks a year, split into four two-week periods across four seasons. This discount is only available at your own store, however.

For all its problems, I stayed a year and a half longer than I had been planning to in my role because I loved the people I worked with, and even though the job could be awful, they would do everything they could to support you and help you through it. Truly, I haven't worked in many places that had a sense of camaraderie and support quite like the one I found among my colleagues working in my branch.","Perpetually understaffed: lost several staff members through shift members and resignations through the years, and they were never replaced. Resulted in a lot of us being overworked, covering two or three people's work regularly and for extended periods of time.

Customers can be very disrespectful. It's little, everyday things, like people hiding rubbish inside stands and tossing stock on the floor, but there were also many cases of customers being outwardly abusive and threatening to staff. Combined with the understaffing, it can create an atmosphere which really does grind you down mentally.

In two years, I was also sexually harassed twice while at work by customers. The impression I got from management when I reported the incidents was that customers harassing staff like this was seen as a somewhat 'usual' thing, and that the only thing you could do was ignore the customers until they went away. I felt like my incidents were never really dealt with, and it left me feeling unsafe at work for some time after they occurred.

Homophobic and transphobic work culture. I frequently heard staff members, supervisors and management use homophobic slurs about and to other members of staff, both in jest and in seriousness. Staff actively mocked the new inclusivity guidelines that were brought in part-way through my contract, including supervisors and members of management. Transgender members of staff, and customers, were frequently and purposefully misgendered. When I brought up this working culture in my exit interview, the manager's only response was that they would make sure to send around the email again with the inclusivity training powerpoint attached. Every time I walked past the Pride display through the summer in my branch, it felt like a bit of a slap in the face, knowing that the reality for LGBT+ staff in my own store was that it could be a very bleak place to work. The store also put up a lot of branding in the last few months about their 'inclusivity' as well, but it was quite misleading, as the inclusivity they referred to was actually regarding the increased scope of their new size range, rather than efforts to be more inclusive towards LGBT+ and POC staff members etc. I deeply felt like Primark were attempting to capitalise monetarily on the illusion of being an inclusive workplace, while never addressing its own deep-seated issues.

No room to progress. Only people that management want to promote have a chance at being interviewed for higher roles, which was said to me and other staff members numerous times by supervisors. Staff are actively kept from being given full time hours.

It’ll be nice to be in, but 0-60 will take 20 years.

Big org, diverse environments to work in. Wonderful people and changeable pace, lots of best practice to learn from. It’s highly regulated, so you see what good looks like every day.

I enjoyed all the teams I worked with. Loved the different divisions and completely different operating models. I worked in many locations. Kingswood, Cardiff, Brighton, London and even regional partners.

I started as a Senior Finance Analyst and progressed to management fairly fast in 2 years. Being a business partner to multiple divisions across a few entities has given me some great insights into operating models, having some challenging projects to work on commercially and financially.

It’s hard to make a difference there; to have a voice and face. I managed to, but had to slog and really push change to sell it more widely. Shouldn’t be so hard to make things better.","In finance it’s hard to get up the chain into senior leadership there and regardless of skills, shining reviews, outstanding performance etc, restructures set people back year in year out, which is pretty awful; there’s a lot of competition from Group finance who are markedly more visible to leadership, so opportunities there is fairly static and staid. You just have to see how long people stay “finance managers” before becoming heads. Some 10 years, (reshuffled, relearn, reestablish, outperform, only to be displaced due to restructure to start all over again). When that happens to the superstars, you know there are issues. 

It’s poorly paid as well. For a FTSE it’s shocking. It’s not until you leave that you realise how bad the pay grades are. Pigeonholed in Finance, in middle management, during the most important time of your career to diversify and grow.

I left, took a seniority cut in different sector, (a charity at that) earning £10,000k more + 20% bonus, was promoted in new role within 6 months. Within a year promoted again as a head in FP&A and Business Improvements. So after pouring heart and soul into that company, to earn peanuts for 7 years at L&G as a high performing Finance Manager, within 4 years of leaving, 2 companies later, I’m now an Operations Director, with loads more experience and on track for a fulfilling career doing what I do best.

I interviewed at legal and general a couple years back in Hove. Unsurprisingly it seemed the world had stopped going back there. Even the tech and ways of working were the same. (Which filled me with dread given how much the world had advanced with MS Teams/interview techniques/tablets etc) I realised it’s a leviathan and will take tens of years to change process and senior leadership. It’s stifling. Systems are still same, ways of working are backward and unsurprisingly, I found myself questioning why I’d want to work there again after tasting what “excellent” looks and feels like.

Quite stark. That industry really grabs a person and pins them in place.

But he was side lined in a 'power grab' re-organisation and I now work for a manager who is a master of de-motivation. Productivity has slumped.

It gave me a foot in the door to other jobs.

Someone that can sit at a desk and smile to high earning men in the morning when they come into work. 

The training did not involve anything that would apply to the role. To be fair, some sites involved doing literally nothing, but others were more involved and included switchboard operation, diary management, room booking software, distributing internal post and using franking machines etc. I did not feel well prepared for these tasks at all (though thankfully, in the busier sites, I was working with very helpful colleagues). 

Really the training was solely devoted to how we would look - so applying makeup, smiling etc. We were also shown an offensively sexist video of a virgin airlines commercial. I think is was meant to inspire but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The other girls at the training just looked uncomfortable and embarrassed. 

It was a very strange experience working for OC as you're not really treated as an employee. There is very little respect or understanding and getting leave for any reason is seen as unacceptable. 

You are contractually obligated to wear high heels and have a full face of make up on every day which I find completely insane - something I associate with the backwards perception of ""women in the workplace"" from the 1950s. 

I found the general atmosphere to be patronising, demeaning and extremely sexist. Also quite hostile at times - my existence seemed more like an inconvenience for them rather than an asset to the company. You definitely feel like you're working for a faceless corporation that have no connection to those actually making them money. And show no appreciation for their hard work and very long working hours (min 50 hours per week but can often be more). I suppose the reason they don't show much care or respect is that everyone is so easily replaceable. It is a bit of a vicious circle. The working conditions are terrible and the staff mistreated so people inevitably leave after a few months, so they don't see the point in trying harder to make conditions better or improve because they know that people will leave, but there will always be young people struggling to find work in London so they will always have this pool to recruit from, no matter how poor the company is everybody has bills to pay. It's a sad state of affairs.

Promotion and acceleration at the company is all about who you know, who is your supporter and at the end of the day very much based on how liked you are by the senior leaders. The vast majority of people at MS are top performers but promotions are more strongly linked to your political maneuvering than the quality of your work.

MS is constantly changing its review method, they went from stack ranking which was a negative experience, to now giving you and end of year assessment but not telling you how you are 'stack ranked' even though they still essentially rank you to decide your bonus level as an example.

I have seen several people brutally pushed out of the company, so if they want to get rid of you there is not much you can do.

My advice; don't join the rate race. Get a job at MS, do what you need to do to perform positively and keep your job and then go home in the evenings and weekends and spend time with your family, friends and loved ones if you value that higher than senior positions/higher pay.
