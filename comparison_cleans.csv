- The training internally is often poor, focussing more on the way the training looks than the content.
- I feel as though whilst working for the firm the ""exceptional client service"" has slipped due to poor resourcing within the firm. An attrition rate of staff is just accepted by the firm, when really this should be highlighted as a major problem. Why not try your hardest to keep knowledge within the firm rather than see it go and bring in less competent external hires
- As a consequence of poor resourcing junior staff are delegated too, causing to perform work beyond their grade without any training support. It also leads them to have no work/life balance as their workload mounts; you end up living and breathing BDO, worrying about your workload at all hours.
- It is great that BDO promotes getting feedback on all jobs, but then this seems to have no consequence in the overall appraisal system. The merit rating system if anything is utterly demoralising and provides little opportunity to reward staff.
- BDO is stupid when winning work. Some partners obviously do not do budgets for fee proposals, and so go in below competition but then want a good recovery on the job. This causes the job to be done with less staff, faster and with lower graded individuals.

- If you are willing to play the game, you can have a career here.","- Forced onto projects that are not aligned with your interests and once locked onto a project, it can be hard to roll off.
- Roles are often mis-sold.
- When preparing you for promotion, certain managers prefer to introduce you to the 'right people', instead of improving your skillset and helping you grow.
- Lots of hype over the latest technology, but very few roles or projects sold in these areas. 
- Most work is mundane implementation of an existing software.

Great culture (friendly people, flexible working, great parental leave).
Good benefits and salary. 
Very creative environment to work and a great place to build your creative excellence.","Leadership
The standard of leadership is quite poor - don't expect a coaching culture.
If you want to be seen as a talented employee, you need to be able to play the political game, build relationships with the right people and agree with whatever they say. A large portion of senior leaders have gotten to where they are because of their ability to play the game, not because they are experts in their field. This is the foundation of why Diageo is so bad at execution of plans. 

Values
Sad to say, the company values are just some words on a website, they are not practiced or enforced. There is a lot of poor behaviour from senior leaders that goes against Diageo's values but goes ignored (bullying, favouritism and neglecting team members).

Global Culture
The Diageo culture I mention in the 'pro list' above, sadly is for the UK only. The business has not succeeded in embedding the UK culture in all markets. If I had to rate the Diageo USA or Africa cultures, it would be a different story.","Amazing brands with big A&P budgets.  Great culture (friendly people, flexible working, great parental leave).

- Everyone is very sociable and many friends made - with constant invites to outside work socialising.","- Better to go to WTW once you have experience. Those who start as administrators will be pushed down, with resistance to reasonable salary rises and promotions. 
- WTW will get you doing the work and job description of a higher level employee without the actual title and salary to match this. Therefore, limiting you from leaving for a higher position elsewhere.
- Lack of training when you start. No one has the time to properly train employees. 
- They value quantity over quality but the blame is strong as soon as mistakes are made.
- Knowledge is bottom heavy. Lower level employees have a lot of knowledge (which is mostly self-taught due to lack of training) and are relied upon to push the high level employees up - whilst being paid a significant amount less.
- Would rather and will pay more to hire people in senior positions (from Senior Administrator and above) and pay significantly less to those promoted from within. 
- Do not reward those with the talent and knowledge and are extremely discouraging and demotivating to work for. 
- Do not care about keeping loyal employees and have a big retention issue with employees in and out constantly.
- Advertise as a flexible working environment - but I did not witness any flexible working during my time and managers are extremely reluctant (mostly refuse) to allow any flexible working - even if you give valid reasoning e.g. an important doctors appointment. 
- I was at WTW for just over a year and watched great, knowledgable employees with high potential leave. I also watched the bottom level employees essentially being the brains for the seniors and managers.
- Work-life balance is not encouraged and extremely poor. Managers trying to get employees with families and children to do overtime - with some left feeling guilty that they are not able to.

Lower level employees have a lot of knowledge (which is mostly self-taught due to lack of training) and are relied upon to push the high level employees up - whilst being paid a significant amount less. - Would rather and will pay more to hire people in senior positions (from Senior Administrator and above) and pay significantly less to those promoted from within.  - Do not reward those with the talent and knowledge and are extremely discouraging and demotivating to work for.  - Do not care about keeping loyal employees and have a big retention issue with employees in and out constantly. - Advertise as a flexible working environment - but I did not witness any flexible working during my time and managers are extremely reluctant (mostly refuse) to allow any flexible working - even if you give valid reasoning e.g. an important doctors appointment.  - I was at WTW for just over a year and watched great, knowledgable employees with high potential leave. I also watched the bottom level employees essentially being the brains for the seniors and managers. - Work-life balance is not encouraged and extremely poor. Managers trying to get employees with families and children to do overtime - with some left feeling guilty that they are not able to.  - Team leaders and managers will admit that there is an issue with the levelling system and promotions/pay rises but are not willing to put in effort to make change.",well to go to wtw once you have experience those who start as administrator will be push down with resistance to reasonable salary rise and promotion wtw will get you do the work and job description of a high level employee without the actual title and salary to match this therefore limit you

82932,Virgin Active,Great working environment and a company you used to be proud to work for.,"The company has recently agreed a sale of a selection of clubs to David Lloyds.

The sale was agreed on 8th of Feb and the hand over date isn't till June however there is very little structure or availability of regional direction within the business. All incentives ran in the company seem to exclude the clubs that have been agreed to be sold.

15345,Barnardo s,"The staff and volunteers in the area are all lovely and so supportive, it feels like being part of a huge family. You meet a lot of people and there are of course some you get on with more than others, but there are many that I consider friends. The work usually isn't hard, but it can be quite monotonous. there's some heavy lifting and manual labour (like heaving 50 bin bags of clothes up a flight of stairs) but it's not every day. The area manager is really helpful, if you have a problem she will try and fix it, and she visits the shops in the area quite a lot to see how we could improve (although the old area manager we never saw and was impossible to get a hold of, I have no idea what he actually did all day). Both staff and volunteers get a 20% discount on stock that is already cheap, so that is a bonus. You have almost free reign of merchandising the shop and displays too, which is great if you like being creative. Each shop has its own personality.","Barnardos are hugely understaffed which means staff have to cover other shops, taking a valuable pair of hands away from their own shop. The paid members of staff also aren't paid for the hours they actually work - I realise it's a charity but people have to make money to live, and if you say that it's a 35 hour contract I expect to work 35 hours. My store is open 9-5.30 every day, but we have to arrive at around 8.30 to open up and get the cash in the till, and it takes another 20 mins or half an hour to cash up in the evening. This is a 9.5 hour day, and we are only paid for 7 of those hours. Most people only take a half an hour lunch break due to the workload, but even if we took a whole hour and 2 15 min breaks, that's still an hour we aren't being paid for. 
A lot of the time, especially for a new store with no volunteers, A member of staff is on their own for many hours or even all day. Personally I don't feel safe doing this but I have no choice as its not a good enough excuse to close the shop, even though there are shoplifters and really anyone could walk into the shop. A few months ago a customer actually hit another manager in the area. Also there's the normal retail stuff like getting verbally abused by customers on a daily basis, mainly because it's against company policy to reduce items. But for every horrible customer there's 20 nice ones.","The staff and volunteers in the area are all lovely and so supportive, it feels like being part of a huge family.

42030,HSBC Holdings,"Strong track record, one of the few financial institutions that weathered recent storms relatively unscathed
It's a large organisation and there are lots of opportunities: some staff seem to do very well in terms of promotions / responsiblities etc
They're generally well-organised
""My choice"" reward package gives you some good choices of non-cash benefits as part of your remuneration package e.g. BUPA healthcare for you & your family.
Good training programmes.
Most colleagues are decent people, some departments have a good social life.","Wages are deliberately set at 10% below the market median.
Frequent restructuring and re-orientation of goals etc means there is a lack of continuity - 100s of man hours invested in projects & initiatives, then one day your boss says ""we're not doing that anymore"".  Inefficient and frustrating.
Excessive red tape and a ""can't do"" attitude amongst middle management.  
A big vote up here for the brainwashing.  Every day you're told HSBC is ""The Best Place to Work"" - this slogan is plastered across foyers in letters 6 foot high.  And for years I believed it... TBH I started to believe there must be something wrong with me, always missed out on promotions, getting poor reviews, very undervalued.  Back at School, Uni and everywhere else I've worked I was always a high achiever, yet at HSBC I always felt like a ne'er do well.  Why?  Because line managers generally don't like people with ideas and initiative, they want Stepford Wives.  
[BTW, HSBC is not ""The Best Place to Work"".  Back in the days when *all* staff completed the staff survey, we used to score 55%-60% staff satisfaction.  There are 100's of companies in the country with staff satisfaction ratings >90%.]
Bullying is rife.  Too many managers throwing their weight around.  Over 12 years I had 9 different line managers, I made complaints against 3.  Not only were my complaints not investigated, HR told me I would be placed on a disciplinary for gross misconduct if I didn't retract a formal grievance. In case you're thinking I'm the over-sensitive whiny type, one complaint was i.r.o. a physical assault, witnessed by numerous colleagues.  Nothing was done about it, no-one would back me up.  People didn't want to ""get involved"".
My opinion is that HSBC's anti-bullying policy is there for show, like a lot of their other policies.  e.g. I also suffered RSI whilst working at HSBC, they took 3 months to undertake a workstation assessment and refused to provide me with an ergonomic mouse - I had to buy my own.  
Morale is low, so many staff I've seen in tears, even threatening suicide because they hate their jobs so much.
Poor communication & secrecy at every level of management.  e.g. Time and time again staff have found out from BBC news that HSBC is making 1000 UK staff redundant, but there is zero internal communication about it.  Staff are left to worry and speculate, whispering in corners.
Regarding IT systems - yes a lot are fairly stone-age.  HSBC overall tend to ""play it safe"", which is one of the reasons they didn't fall into the money market sinkhole back in 2007/2008, but it also means they choose to avoid being at ""the leading edge"" of anything, because the leading edge is often the bleeding edge.
Also ofc new things cost money: if you've not worked for a financial institution, please understand that everything is about money.  And it seems nothing else matters.","Strong track record, one of the few financial institutions that weathered recent storms relatively unscathed It's a large organisation and there are lots of opportunities: some staff seem to do very well in terms of promotions / responsiblities etc They're generally well-organised ""My choice"" reward package gives you some good choices of non-cash benefits as part of your remuneration package e.g. BUPA healthcare for you & your family.

Back in the days when *all* staff completed the staff survey, we used to score 55%-60% staff satisfaction.  There are 100's of companies in the country with staff satisfaction ratings >90%.] Bullying is rife.  Too many managers throwing their weight around.  Over 12 years I had 9 different line managers, I made complaints against 3.  Not only were my complaints not investigated, HR told me I would be placed on a disciplinary for gross misconduct if I didn't retract a formal grievance. In case you're thinking I'm the over-sensitive whiny type, one complaint was i.r.o. a physical assault, witnessed by numerous colleagues.  Nothing was done about it, no-one would back me up.  People didn't want to ""get involved"". My opinion is that HSBC's anti-bullying policy is there for show, like a lot of their other policies.  e.g. I also suffered RSI whilst working at HSBC, they took 3 months to undertake a workstation assessment and refused to provide me with an ergonomic mouse - I had to buy my own.   Morale is low, so many staff I've seen in tears, even threatening suicide because they hate their jobs so much. Poor communication & secrecy at every level of management.  e.g. Time and time again staff have found out from BBC news that HSBC is making 1000 UK staff redundant, but there is zero internal communication about it.  Staff are left to worry and speculate, whispering in corners. Regarding IT systems - yes a lot are fairly stone-age.  HSBC overall tend to ""play it safe"", which is one of the reasons they didn't fall into the money market sinkhole back in 2007/2008, but it also means they choose to avoid being at ""the leading edge"" of anything, because the leading edge is often the bleeding edge. Also ofc new things cost money: if you've not worked for a financial institution, please understand that everything is about money.  And it seems nothing else matters.",wage be deliberately set at 10 below the market median frequent restructuring and re orientation of goal etc mean there be a lack of continuity 100s of man hour

22471,Care UK,"-Better than average base rate pay for day shifts at £9.50 an hour
- Intriguing incentives most months for bonuses (usually around £250-£300) dependent on performance  in areas such as attendance and punctuality. 
- Night shift base rate is considerably low at just £2 more than day rates at £11.50 an hour, however, if such shift was agreed to as overtime, there is a high likelihood this will be paid at either 1.5 or 2 times the standing rate.
- Weekend base pay rate is at £12 an hour and overtime is usually in high demand. -The option for text messages with alerts and overtime requests from supervisors  can be useful.
-Excellent and thorough training to achieve an NHS Pathways License over four weeks if training is completed on a full time basis. (Monday - Friday from 9:00am - 5:00pm. (Some training days won't require a full day to complete so the session is concluded earlier.)
- Senior members of the team are trusted, passionate and knowledgeable. 
- Annual Leave allowance is high, dependent on the amount of hours contracted.
- Annual Leave can be booked in hours and days using an online portal.(No more than 14 days at any time).
- Experienced and knowledgeable clinical nurses and paramedics working alongside Health Advisors.","- Lack of support from supervisors (mainly due to lack of spare staff), especially during vital periods, including when you first begin taking calls from the public. 
- Inexperienced members of the team enduring managerial tasks early in their tenure due to the lack of said supervisors. 
- Lack of clinically trained staff during night shifts and some busy periods.
- Disorderly distribution of important local policy updates which happen regularly and affect all acting members of the call center. (Call audits are carried out regularly and are awarded a pass for the adherence to policy procedures. In cases where a Health Advisor has failed to have information about a policy update communicated to them by a supervisor, they will receive call audit results that have likely failed.) In general, the company lacks a sense of transparency about said matters, both in just the local office, and when conversing and dealing with other Care UK call centers around the country. These are policy's which are to be adhered to during all calls and are an important function to the standards set by NHS 111. 
- If, for any unfortunate reason, during their tenure at Care UK, a Health Advisor is to find themselves taking any time off due to sickness, (of any nature, including temporary minor flu's, sickness bugs, to long term debilitating life changing illness) they will find they are dealt with mechanically and abruptly by those supervisors and managers who are proceeding their sickness absence meetings. It is possible for a Health Advisor to be suffering from an emergency medical issue and find a risk to their position with the company due to their regimented and difficult approach to issues of this nature. Because of a three stage warning system, it means that a Health Advisor will face the possibility of loosing their position at the third stage as one of two options. The alternative options are a decision not to award them with a sickness absence stage on their HR record. And then there are bans, as such, on time off for sickness, for extended periods between 6-12 months to avoid facing an immediate ascent to the next sickness absence stage. All in all suffering from any form of illness and having to deal with the process at Care UK, is not usually well received especially with the nature from which it is delivered by some of the supervisors and managers. 
- A Health Advisor will face life threatening situations to manage over the telephone. This is a serious task, and requires making vital, potentially life saving decisions and Health Advisors should be accompanied by managerial support at all times. Rarely, dependent on the managerial skill, a Health Advisor may find a lack of support in dealing with calls of this nature.
- Because of the nature of the role, shifts in such a work place should not be extended or expected to be, rather, beyond 6 hours, so that Health Advisors can retain full concentration and attention to the calls. 
- Very poor management skills dealing with Health Advisors experiencing bereavement.

32906,Dixons Carphone,Some of the benefits are really great,"This company has the most careless and messy HR department I have ever seen. Their processes are contradicting documentation and HR reps would not respond unless they are emailed by some of the directors.

First month back from the maternity leave I was not paid. After investigating it turned out there was an important paperwork missing. I had contacted my HR rep 4 times during my mat leave but they never replied to my emails, not to even mention I had never received any information in regards this documentation. Appears they also had never advised my line manager what documentation exactly should have been filled.  I received zero assistance from them when I tried to figure out what has happened to my pay.

This was not enough - next month payroll team had messed up my tax code: because of their previous failure HMRC had triggered a less beneficial tax code and I received 25% decrease in my salary because I overpaid the tax. 

Thankfully I am leaving this company this month; the payroll still have not updated my tax code although HMRC has corrected the error in their end. I'll leave the business without having peace of mind that at least my final pay will be correct.

This experience has been very frustrating and humiliating, I would have never thought I would need to worry about being able to fill my financial commitments working in a public company.

The Mission - Promoting the independence, inclusion and well being of people with support needs. What the company are trying to achieve is great. 

Flexible - Management do what they can to support employees with flexible working and a work/ life balance.

CEO- The CEO Anna is so committed to Creative Support and is always available to speak to. Anna gets involved in every aspect of the company and is very hands on.","The Payroll Department - There are far too many issues that need resolving in the payroll department. Employees cannot get through to the payroll team via telephone and its not acceptable. 

Timesheets - There are too many issues with processing timesheets that cause pay issues. New ideas are needed to resolve this as management spend their valuable time chasing timesheets.

Wages- I appreciate that CS is a not for profit charitable organisation however the jobs that Support Workers are expected to undertake needs to be reflected in the pay. 

Retention- The company relies too much on agency staff and needs to invest in its recruitment process and retaining its valuable employees.

27826,David Lloyd Leisure,Working in sales is challenging and I love it. Challenger sales really helps you take control of conversations between you and prospects and ultimately gives a real sense of achievement. Love it.,"You hear freedom to succeed been spoke about. Basically they give you what you need and you .ca  do what you need to to get where you want too. Atonamy..... great, every employee loves the fact they can have a impact directly on their destiny by doing what they feel works best. 

In reality there's a whole load of non- negotionables. Basically a contradiction in the statement. There is so many barriers. In 2 months I have been directly told that i will loose my job if non negotionables are not met. Great first impression to a time top 30 company. 

In addition the processes are old fashioned. Paperwork, Paperwork, paperwork. A company such as this should be more innovative. It's stuck in the 80s. 

Lastly the company commission structure means you paid more on delivering some membership which means your not always selling with integrity. Integrity being an conpany non negotionables 😂.  Your paid unfairly on the on people who join under corporate discount. Discount that is decided by the business.",Working in sales is challenging and I love it.
